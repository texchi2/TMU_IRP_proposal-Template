		  radiation. Because hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1$\alpha$
		  plays an essential role in oxygen homeostasis in vitro, we
		  explored the predictive potential of this factor in a

		  oropharynx, who were treated by curative radiation therapy.
		  Ninety-four {\%} of the primary tumors showed
		  overexpression of HIF-1$\alpha$, relative to the

		  The degree of HIF-1$\alpha$ immunoreactivity correlated
		  inversely with both the rate of complete remission of the

		  metastases (odds ratio, 0.34; P = 0.02) as well as with

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The heart derives energy from a wide variety
		  of substrates including fatty acids, carbohydrates,
		  ketones, and amino acids. The healthy heart generates up to
		  30{\%} of its ATP from glucose. Under conditions of cardiac
		  injury or stress, the heart relies even more heavily on
		  glucose as a source of fuel. Glucose is transported into
		  the heart by members of the family of facilitative glucose
		  transporters (GLUTs). While research examining the
		  transport of glucose into the heart has primarily focused
		  on the roles of the classical glucose transporters GLUT1
		  and GLUT4, little is known about the functions of more
		  newly identified GLUT isoforms in the myocardium. METHODS:
		  In this study the presence and relative RNA message
		  abundance of each of the known GLUT isoforms was determined
		  in left ventricular tissue from two commonly used inbred
		  laboratory mouse strains (C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ) by
		  quantitative real time PCR. Relative message abundance was
		  also determined in GLUT4 null mice and in murine models of
		  dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: GLUT4,
		  GLUT1, and GLUT8 were found to be the most abundant GLUT
		  transcripts in the normal heart, while GLUT3, GLUT10, and
		  GLUT12 are present at relatively lower levels. Assessment
		  of relative GLUT expression in left ventricular myocardium
		  from mice with dilated cardiomyopathy revealed increased
		  expression of GLUT1 with reduced levels of GLUT4, GLUT8,
		  and GLUT12. Compensatory increase in the expression of
		  GLUT12 was observed in genetically altered mice lacking
		  GLUT4. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose transporter expression varies
		  significantly among murine models of cardiac dysfunction
		  and involves several of the class III GLUT isoforms.
		  Understanding how these more newly identified GLUT isoforms
		  contribute to regulating myocardial glucose transport will
		  enhance our comprehension of the normal physiology and
		  pathophysiology of the heart.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Analyzing high throughput genomics data is a
		  complex and compute intensive task, generally requiring
		  numerous software tools and large reference data sets, tied
		  together in successive stages of data transformation and
		  visualisation. A computational platform enabling best
		  practice genomics analysis ideally meets a number of
		  requirements, including: a wide range of analysis and
		  visualisation tools, closely linked to large user and
		  reference data sets; workflow platform(s) enabling
		  accessible, reproducible, portable analyses, through a
		  flexible set of interfaces; highly available, scalable
		  computational resources; and flexibility and versatility in
		  the use of these resources to meet demands and expertise of
		  a variety of users. Access to an appropriate computational
		  platform can be a significant barrier to researchers, as
		  establishing such a platform requires a large upfront
		  investment in hardware, experience, and expertise. RESULTS:
		  We designed and implemented the Genomics Virtual Laboratory
		  (GVL) as a middleware layer of machine images, cloud
		  management tools, and online services that enable
		  researchers to build arbitrarily sized compute clusters on
		  demand, pre-populated with fully configured bioinformatics
		  tools, reference datasets and workflow and visualisation
		  options. The platform is flexible in that users can conduct
		  analyses through web-based (Galaxy, RStudio, IPython
		  Notebook) or command-line interfaces, and add/remove
		  compute nodes and data resources as required. Best-practice
		  tutorials and protocols provide a path from introductory
		  training to practice. The GVL is available on the
		  OpenStack-based Australian Research Cloud
		  (http://nectar.org.au) and the Amazon Web Services cloud.
		  The principles, implementation and build process are
		  designed to be cloud-agnostic. CONCLUSIONS: This paper
		  provides a blueprint for the design and implementation of a
		  cloud-based Genomics Virtual Laboratory. We discuss scope,
		  design considerations and technical and logistical
		  constraints, and explore the value added to the research
		  community through the suite of services and resources

  abstract	= {Murine double minute (MDM2) binding protein (MTBP) has
		  been implicated in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate
		  one mechanism by which MTBP inhibits cancer metastasis.
		  Overexpression of MTBP in human osteosarcoma cell lines
		  lacking wild-type p53 did not alter primary tumor growth in
		  mice, but significantly inhibited metastases. MTBP
		  downregulation increased the migratory potential of
		  MDM2(-/-)p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting
		  that MTBP inhibited cell migration independently of the
		  Mdm2-p53 pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass
		  spectrometric analysis identified alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4)
		  as an MTBP-interacting protein. Endogenous MTBP interacted
		  with and partially colocalized with ACTN4. MTBP
		  overexpression inhibited cell migration and filopodia
		  formation mediated by ACTN4. Increased cell migration by
		  MTBP downregulation was inhibited by concomitant
		  downregulation of ACTN4. MTBP also inhibited ACTN4-mediated
		  F-actin bundling. We furthermore demonstrated that nuclear
		  localization of MTBP was dispensable for inhibiting
		  ACTN4-mediated cell migration and filopodia formation.
		  Thus, MTBP suppresses cell migration, at least partially,
		  by inhibiting ACTN4 function. Our study not only provides a
		  mechanism of metastasis suppression by MTBP, but also
		  suggests MTBP as a potential biomarker for cancer
		  progression.},

		  responsible for the endogenous synthesis of fatty acids. It
		  is downregulated in most normal cells, except in lipogenic
		  tissues such as liver, lactating breast, fetal lung and
		  adipose tissue. Conversely, several human cancers,
		  including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC),
		  overexpress FASN, which has been associated with poor

		  oncoprotein. Orlistat is an irreversible inhibitor of FASN
		  activity with cytotoxic properties on several cancer cell
		  lines that inhibits tumor progression and metastasis in
		  prostate cancer xenografts and experimental melanomas,
		  respectively. To explore whether the inhibition of FASN
		  could impact oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC)
		  metastatic spread, an orthotopic model was developed by the
		  implantation of SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells into the tongue of
		  BALB/c nude mice. These cells were isolated through in vivo
		  selection, show a more invasive behavior in vitro than the

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of chromosome band 11q13 are
		  frequent in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
		  (SCCHN). The oncogene CCND1 is located at 11q13 and encodes
		  cyclin D1, a cell cycle-regulating protein. The authors
		  investigated the clinical relevance and associations
		  between amplification and overexpression of cyclin D1 and
		  11q13 rearrangements. METHODS: The study involved two
		  series of patients. In Series 1, overexpression of cyclin
		  D1 and 11q13 rearrangements, assessed by
		  immunohistochemistry and cytogenetics, respectively, were
		  compared with clinical data in 75 patients with SCCHN.
		  Patients were monitored for at least 18 months or until
		  death. In another 23 patients (Series 2), the authors
		  investigated the association between DNA amplification (by
		  slot blot hybridization), overexpression of cyclin D1, and
		  cytogenetics. RESULTS: In Series 1, 9 of 75 tumors (12{\%})
		  had 11q13 aberrations, 6 of which manifested elevated
		  expression of cyclin D1. Patients with tumors strongly
		  positive for cyclin D1 (n = 9) and those with tumors
		  showing 11q13 rearrangements had poorer survival (P = 0.047
		  and 0.005, respectively). However, the correlation between
		  these two variables was weak (P = 0.12). In Series 2, 17 of
		  23 tumors (74{\%}) showed elevated cyclin D1 protein
		  expression, and 6 of these showed gene amplification as
		  well. Of these six, only one revealed 11q13 rearrangements.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cyclin D1 and 11q13
		  rearrangements are independent prognostic factors for
		  SCCHN. In general, DNA amplification results in
		  overexpression of cyclin D1, but additional genetic
		  mechanisms are involved in the deregulation. Furthermore,
		  oncogenes at 11q13 besides CCND1 may be involved in the
		  tumorigenesis.},

  abstract	= {An important application of DNA microarray data is cancer
		  classification. Because of the high-dimensionality problem
		  of microarray data, gene selection approaches are often
		  employed to support the expert systems in diagnostic
		  capability of cancer with high classification accuracy.
		  Penalized logistic regression using the least absolute
		  shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is one of the key
		  steps in high-dimensional cancer classification, as gene
		  coefficient estimation and gene selection simultaneously.
		  However, the LASSO has been criticized for being biased in
		  gene selection. The adaptive LASSO (APLR) was originally
		  proposed to overcome the selection bias by assigning a
		  consistent weight to each gene. In high-dimensional data,
		  however, the adaptive LASSO faces practical problems in
		  choosing the type of initial weight. In practice, the LASSO
		  estimator itself has been used as an initial weight.
		  However, this may not be preferable because the LASSO is
		  inconsistent in itself. To address this issue, an
		  alternative initial weight in adaptive penalized logistic
		  regression (CBPLR) is proposed. The effectiveness of the
		  CBPLR is examined on three well-known high-dimensional
		  cancer classification datasets using number of selected
		  genes, area under the curve, and misclassification rate.
		  The experimental results reveal that the proposed CBPLR is
		  quite efficient and feasible for cancer classification.
		  Additionally, the proposed weight is compared with APLR and
		  LASSO and exhibits competitive performance in both
		  classification accuracy and gene selection. The proposed
		  CBPLR has significant impact in penalized logistic
		  regression by selecting fewer genes with high area under
		  the curve and low misclassification rate. Thus, the
		  proposed weight could conceivably be used in other research
		  that implements gene selection in the field of high
		  dimensional cancer classification.},

		  aggressive, genetically complex and difficult to treat
		  group of cancers. In lieu of truly effective targeted
		  therapies, surgery and radiotherapy represent the primary
		  treatment options for most patients. But these treatments
		  are associated with significant morbidity and a reduction
		  in quality of life. Resistance to both radiotherapy and the
		  only available targeted therapy, and subsequent relapse are
		  common. Research has therefore focussed on identifying
		  biomarkers to stratify patients into clinically meaningful
		  groups and to develop more effective targeted therapies.
		  However, as we are now discovering, the poor response to
		  therapy and aggressive nature of HNSCCs is not only
		  affected by the complex alterations in intracellular
		  signalling pathways but is also heavily influenced by the
		  behaviour of the extracellular microenvironment. The HNSCC
		  tumour landscape is an environment permissive of these
		  tumours' aggressive nature, fostered by the actions of the
		  immune system, the response to tumour hypoxia and the
		  influence of the microbiome. Solving these challenges now
		  rests on expanding our knowledge of these areas, in
		  parallel with a greater understanding of the molecular
		  biology of HNSCC subtypes. This update aims to build on our

		  of p53 have been described to influence the
		  radiosensitivity of tumour cells from head and neck
		  carcinomas. The present study was performed to evaluate
		  whether TP53 mutation may influence the clinical outcome of
		  head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or
		  surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from
		  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from
		  primary biopsies taken before radiotherapy. Gene mutations
		  (in exons 5-9) were identified using denaturing gradient
		  gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as the initial scanning
		  procedure and characterized by sequencing. Patients were
		  treated with primary radiotherapy or surgery alone.
		  Treatment was given according to the DAHANCA schedules with
		  5 or 6 weekly fractions (2 Gy) of radiotherapy (66-68 Gy).
		  Most patients were also treated with the hypoxic
		  radiosensitizer Nimorazole. The results are reported as
		  5-year actuarial values, and differences estimated by
		  log-rank analysis. RESULTS: The present analysis is based
		  on 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx,
		  pharynx and oral cavity diagnosed between March 1992 and
		  October 1996. Ninety patients received primary radiotherapy
		  alone and 21 were treated with surgery. TP53 mutations were
		  found in 45 patients (39{\%}) and in patients receiving
		  radiotherapy, TP53 mutation was highly associated with poor
		  prognosis. Loco-regional control rates (5-year actuarial
		  values) for TP53 mutation was 29 vs. 54{\%} for TP53
		  wildtype (P {\textless} 0.01). For disease-free survival
		  the corresponding values were 13 and 38{\%} (P {\textless}
		  0.01), respectively. The correlations were not found to be
		  related to specific subtypes of mutations (e.g. missense
		  mutations affecting DNA-contact or Zn-binding regions) but
		  rather to the presence of any mutation at all. In contrast,
		  TP53 mutation did not influence the response to surgery.
		  CONCLUSIONS: A strong relationship was observed between

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Hazard ratios are ubiquitously used in time to
		  event applications to quantify adjusted covariate effects.
		  Although hazard ratios are invaluable for hypothesis
		  testing, other adjusted measures of association, both
		  relative and absolute, should be provided to fully
		  appreciate studies results. The corrected group prognosis
		  method is generally used to estimate the absolute risk
		  reduction and the number needed to be treated for
		  categorical covariates.
		  
		  METHODS: The goal of this paper is to present
		  transformation models for time-to-event outcomes to obtain,
		  directly from estimated coefficients, the measures of
		  association widely used in biostatistics together with
		  their confidence interval. Pseudo-values are used for a
		  practical estimation of transformation models.
		  
		  RESULTS: Using the regression model estimated through
		  pseudo-values with suitable link functions, relative risks,
		  risk differences and the number needed to treat, are
		  obtained together with their confidence intervals. One
		  example based on literature data and one original
		  application to the study of prognostic factors in primary
		  retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas are presented. A
		  simulation study is used to show some properties of the
		  different estimation methods.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Clinically useful measures of treatment or
		  exposure effect are widely available in epidemiology. When
		  time to event outcomes are present, the analysis is
		  performed generally resorting to predicted values from Cox
		  regression model. It is now possible to resort to more
		  general regression models, adopting suitable link functions
		  and pseudo values for estimation, to obtain alternative
		  measures of effect directly from regression coefficients
		  together with their confidence interval. This may be
		  especially useful when, in presence of time dependent
		  covariate effects, it is not straightforward to specify the
		  correct, if any, time dependent functional form. The method
		  can easily be implemented with standard software.},

		  the overall impact of improvements in cancer treatment. The
		  rapid evolution of knowledge in cancer biology and the
		  discovery and validation of biologic factors that predict
		  cancer outcome and response to treatment with better
		  accuracy have led some cancer experts to question the
		  utility of a TNM-based approach in clinical care at an
		  individualized patient level. In the Eighth Edition of the
		  AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the goal of including relevant,
		  nonanatomic (including molecular) factors has been
		  foremost, although changes are made only when there is
		  strong evidence for inclusion. The editorial board viewed
		  this iteration as a proactive effort to continue to build
		  the important bridge from a "population-based" to a more
		  "personalized" approach to patient classification, one that
		  forms the conceptual framework and foundation of cancer
		  staging in the era of precision molecular oncology. The
		  AJCC promulgates best staging practices through each new
		  edition in an effort to provide cancer care providers with
		  a powerful, knowledge-based resource for the battle against
		  cancer. In this commentary, the authors highlight the
		  overall organizational and structural changes as well as
		  "what's new" in the Eighth Edition. It is hoped that this
		  information will provide the reader with a better
		  understanding of the rationale behind the aggregate
		  proposed changes and the exciting developments in the

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is
		  one of the 10 most common cancers with a 50{\%} five-year
		  survival rate, which has remained unchanged for the past
		  three decades. One of the major reasons for the
		  aggressiveness of this cancer is that HNSCCs readily
		  metastasize to cervical lymph nodes that are abundant in
		  the head and neck region. Hence, discovering new molecules
		  controlling the metastatic process as well as understanding
		  their regulation at the molecular level are essential for
		  effective therapeutic strategies.
		  
		  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rab25 expression level was analyzed in
		  HNSCC tissue microarray. We used a combination of
		  intravital microscopy in live animals and
		  immunofluorescence in an in vitro invasion assay to study
		  the role of Rab25 in tumor cell migration and invasion.
		  
		  RESULTS: In this study, we identified the small GTPase
		  Rab25 as a key regulator of HNSCC metastasis. We observed
		  that Rab25 is downregulated in HNSCC patients. Next, we
		  determined that reexpression of Rab25 in a metastatic cell
		  line is sufficient to block invasion in a three-dimensional
		  collagen matrix and metastasis to cervical lymph nodes in a
		  mouse model for oral cancer. Specifically, Rab25 affects
		  the organization of F-actin at the cell surface, rather
		  than cell proliferation, apoptosis, or tumor angiogenesis.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Rab25 plays an
		  important role in tumor migration and metastasis, and that
		  understanding its function may lead to the development of
		  new strategies to prevent metastasis in oral cancer
		  patients.},

  abstract	= {Neuropeptides B and W (NPB and NPW) are endogenous ligands
		  of two G protein-coupled receptors, named GPR7 and GPR8.
		  GPR7 and GPR8 are expressed in the adrenal cortex, and
		  there is evidence that NPB and NPW stimulate glucocorticoid
		  secretion from human adrenocortical cells by activating
		  protein kinase (PK) A and PKC signaling. To gain insight
		  into the role of NPB and NPW in human adrenal functional
		  regulation, we have investigated their effects on the
		  secretion and growth of the human adrenocortical
		  carcinoma-derived NCI-H295 cell line. NCI-H295 cells were
		  found to express both GPR7 and GPR8 mRNAs, but neither NPB
		  nor NPW (up to 10(-6) M) affected their secretory activity.
		  In contrast, both peptides (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M)
		  enhanced the growth of NCI-H295 cells, by raising their
		  proliferative activity and lowering their apoptotic
		  deletion rate. NPB and NPW (10(-6) M) stimulated tyrosine
		  kinase (TK) and mitogen-activated PK (MAPK) p42/p44
		  activities in NCI-H295 cells. Both these effects were
		  blocked by the TK inhibitor tyrphostin-23, while the MAPK
		  p42/p44 inhibitor PD-98059 annulled only MAPK p42/p44
		  activation. The growth-stimulating effect of 10(-6) M NPB
		  and NPW were not affected by either the PKA and PKC
		  inhibitors H-89 and calphostin-C or the MAPK p38 antagonist
		  SB-293580, but were abolished by both tyrphostin-23 and
		  PD-98059. Taken together, our findings allow us to conclude
		  that GPR7 and GPR8 expressed in NCI-H295 cells: i) are, at
		  variance with those present in normal human adrenocortical
		  cells, uncoupled to PKA- and PKC-dependent cascades,
		  thereby explaining the absence of any secretory response to
		  NPB and NPW; and ii) are coupled to the TK-dependent MAPK
		  p42/p44 signaling, whose activation mediates the

  abstract	= {J Oral Pathol Med (2011) 40: 208–213 Background: Oral
		  submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic debilitating disease
		  and a premalignant condition of the oral cavity
		  characterized by generalized submucosal fibrosis.
		  Myofibroblasts are contractile cells expressing
		  $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA) and are
		  considered primary producers of extracellular matrix after
		  injury. Their accumulation has been established as a marker
		  of progressive fibrosis in organs like lungs, liver, kidney
		  and skin. This study aims to evaluate the presence of
		  myofibroblasts in various histological stages of OSMF.
		  Materials and Method: Seventy cases of OSMF, which were
		  further categorized histologically into early (35 cases)
		  and advanced (35 cases), were subjected to
		  immunohistochemistry using $\alpha$-SMA antibody for
		  detection of myofibroblasts. Fifteen normal oral mucosa
		  specimens were also stained as controls. Results: The
		  number of $\alpha$-SMA-stained myofibroblasts in OSMF was
		  significantly increased when compared to that of the normal
		  controls (P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, a
		  statistically significant increase in the myofibroblasts
		  population between early and advanced stages was observed
		  (P = 0.000). Conclusions: Our results corroborate the
		  possibility that OSMF actually represents an abnormal
		  healing process in response to chronic mechanical and
		  chemical irritation because of areca nut chewing as
		  demonstrated by the increased incidence of myofibroblasts
		  in this disease. Furthermore, the progressive increase in
		  myofibroblasts from early to advanced stages suggests their
		  potential use as markers for evaluating the severity of OSMF.},

  abstract	= {J Oral Pathol Med (2011) 40: 208–213 Background: Oral
		  submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic debilitating disease
		  and a premalignant condition of the oral cavity
		  characterized by generalized submucosal fibrosis.
		  Myofibroblasts are contractile cells expressing
		  $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA) and are
		  considered primary producers of extracellular matrix after
		  injury. Their accumulation has been established as a marker
		  of progressive fibrosis in organs like lungs, liver, kidney
		  and skin. This study aims to evaluate the presence of
		  myofibroblasts in various histological stages of OSMF.
		  Materials and Method: Seventy cases of OSMF, which were
		  further categorized histologically into early (35 cases)
		  and advanced (35 cases), were subjected to
		  immunohistochemistry using $\alpha$-SMA antibody for
		  detection of myofibroblasts. Fifteen normal oral mucosa
		  specimens were also stained as controls. Results: The
		  number of $\alpha$-SMA-stained myofibroblasts in OSMF was
		  significantly increased when compared to that of the normal
		  controls (P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, a
		  statistically significant increase in the myofibroblasts
		  population between early and advanced stages was observed
		  (P = 0.000). Conclusions: Our results corroborate the
		  possibility that OSMF actually represents an abnormal
		  healing process in response to chronic mechanical and
		  chemical irritation because of areca nut chewing as
		  demonstrated by the increased incidence of myofibroblasts
		  in this disease. Furthermore, the progressive increase in
		  myofibroblasts from early to advanced stages suggests their
		  potential use as markers for evaluating the severity of OSMF.},

		  deficiency in nontransformed thyrocytes results in a global
		  downregulation of Krebs cycle and OXPHOS gene expression,
		  defective mitochondria, reduced respiration, and an
		  enhancement in compensatory glycolysis. We found that this
		  process does not involve any of the pathways classically
		  associated with the Warburg effect. Moreover, this process
		  was independent of proliferation but contributed directly
		  to thyroid hyperplasia. Our findings define a novel

		  transporter 4 (GLUT4) exocytosis by promoting GLUT4 vesicle
		  docking/fusion with the membrane. Less is known about the
		  mechanism and regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis, particularly
		  in myocytes. Here, we show that GLUT4 internalization in L6
		  myoblasts was inhibited in part by hypertonicity or
		  clathrin heavy chain knockdown and in part by cholesterol
		  depletion. Both strategies had additive effects, abolishing
		  GLUT4 endocytosis. GLUT4 internalization was abrogated by

		  inhibiting caveolar-dependent endocytosis through
		  syntaxin-6 knockdown or caveolin mutants (which reduced

		  internalization rate or sensitivity to clathrin or
		  cholesterol depletion. In contrast, the mitochondrial
		  uncoupler dinitrophenol (DNP), which like insulin increases
		  surface GLUT4, reduced GLUT4 (but not transferrin)
		  internalization, an effect additive to that of depleting
		  clathrin but not cholesterol. Trout GLUT4 (a natural

  abstract	= {The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently

		  PI3K isoforms play an essential role in the signal
		  transduction events activated by cell surface receptors
		  including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and
		  G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are eight known
		  PI3K isoforms in humans, which have been subdivided into
		  three classes (I-III). Therefore PI3Ks show considerable
		  diversity and it remains unclear which kinases in this
		  family should be targeted in cancer. The class I(A) of PI3K
		  comprises the p110alpha, p110beta and p110delta isoforms,
		  which associate with activated RTKs. In human cancer,
		  recent reports have described activating mutations in the
		  PIK3CA gene encoding p110alpha, and inactivating mutations
		  in the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene, a
		  tumour suppressor and antagonist of the PI3K pathway. The
		  PIK3CA mutations described in cancer constitutively
		  activate p110alpha and, when expressed in cells drive
		  oncogenic transformation. Moreover, these mutations cause
		  the constitutive activation of downstream signaling
		  molecules such as Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), mammalian
		  target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase
		  (S6K) that is commonly observed in cancer cells. In
		  addition to p110alpha, the other isoforms of the PI3K
		  family may also play a role in human cancer, although their
		  individual functions remain to be precisely identified. In
		  this review we will discuss the evidence implicating
		  individual PI3K isoforms in human cancer and their
		  potential as drug targets in this context.},

		  We investigated the association between bisphosphonate

		  Cases were patients aged 18 years or over, either living or

  abstract	= {Objectives The resection status is one of the most
		  important prognostic factors for patients with head and
		  neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) concerning overall
		  survival (OS) and recurrence free interval (RFI). To assess
		  whether therapy concepts changed depending on different
		  resection margins and extracapsular extension, OS and RFI
		  data were set into clinical context. Methods All HNSCC
		  patients who underwent head and neck surgery with/without
		  adjuvant therapy (n=534) were selected over a ten-year
		  period (2001-2011). Clinical parameters and survival data
		  were collected retrospectively and histopathological
		  analysis of tumor free margins and extracapsular extension
		  were done. Results Patients with microscopic in-sano
		  resection showed mean OS/RFI of 95/96 months. OS/RFI
		  decreased in microscopic non-in-sano and macroscopic
		  non-in-sano (56/58 and 35/39 months) as well as in unclear
		  resection margins (63/60 months). Patients with
		  extracapsular extension, microscopic non-in-sano resection
		  as well as patients with in-sano resection after follow up
		  resection demonstrated therapy escalation by adjuvant
		  (chemo-) radiation. Conclusions Insufficient surgical
		  margins and extracapsular extension are main risks for a
		  reduced overall and recurrence free survival. Although
		  there is no measure to prevent positive extracapsular
		  extension, clear margins at first pass protect patients
		  from adjuvant therapy escalation.},

		  FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP(L)) accounts for apoptosis
		  resistance in a context of functional p53 and resistance
		  could be overcome by c-FLIP(L) downmodulation. Here, we

		  Tumor tissue from 207 patients diagnosed with primary EOC

		  and p53 expressions, and multiple correspondence analysis
		  (MCA) was used to evaluate the multivariable pattern of

		  related (P = 0.0001; odds ratio = 0.29, confidence interval
		  (CI) = 0.15-0.055). MCA indicated that p53 accumulation was
		  associated to clinical-pathological variables, while

  abstract	= {One of the phenotypes of mice with targeted disruption of
		  the uncoupling protein-2 gene (Ucp2−/−) is greater
		  macrophage phagocytic activity and free radical production,
		  resulting in a striking resistance to infectious
		  microorganisms. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of
		  this enhanced immune response were investigated. We found
		  that levels of nitric oxide measured in either plasma or
		  isolated macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice are
		  significantly elevated in response to bacterial
		  lipopolysaccharide challenge compared with similarly
		  treated Ucp2+/+ mice. Likewise, expression of inducible
		  nitric-oxide synthase and inflammatory cytokines is higher
		  in Ucp2−/− mice in vivo and in vitro. Key steps in the
		  activation cascade of nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B,
		  including I$\kappa$B kinase and nuclear translocation of
		  NF-$\kappa$B subunits, are all remarkably enhanced in
		  Ucp2−/− mice, most notably even under basal conditions.
		  The elevated basal activity of I$\kappa$B kinase in
		  macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice can be blocked by
		  cell-permeable inhibitors of superoxide and hydrogen
		  peroxide generation, but not by a specific inhibitor for
		  inducible nitric-oxide synthase. Isolated mitochondria from
		  Ucp2−/− cells produced more superoxide/hydrogen
		  peroxide. We conclude that mitochrondrially derived
		  reactive oxygen from Ucp2−/− cells constitutively
		  activates NF-$\kappa$B, resulting in a “primed” state
		  to both potentiate and amplify the inflammatory response
		  upon subsequent stimulation. Uncoupling protein (UCP)1-2 is
		  a mitochondrial inner membrane carrier protein that was
		  discovered through its homology to the brown fat UCP1 (1).
		  Whereas UCP1 has been clearly established as the molecular
		  mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis (reviewed in Ref.
		  2), the function of UCP2 remains somewhat of an enigma.
		  Several features of UCP2 led us to initially propose that
		  it was a bona fide uncoupling protein involved in the
		  dissipation of excess metabolic fuel as heat. These aspects
		  of UCP2 included its structural resemblance to UCP1, its
		  ability to uncouple respiration in model assay systems, and
		  a chromosomal location to a region with genetic linkage to
		  obesity and hyperinsulinemia (1, 3). However, although Ucp2
		  mRNA is expressed in a broad array of tissues in humans and
		  rodent models (3, 4), including metabolically important
		  organs, it exists in minute amounts compared with the level
		  of UCP1 in brown fat. Moreover, it is present in cell types
		  such as pancreatic $\beta$-cells, lymphocytes, and neurons
		  that are not typically associated with thermogenesis
		  (5–7). These and other features of UCP2 (8), together
		  with the critical finding that targeted disruption of the
		  Ucp2 gene did not result in obesity, cold sensitivity, or
		  demonstrable differences in coupling efficiency in isolated
		  mitochondria (9–11), strongly suggested a functionally
		  distinct role for this protein. One of the phenotypes of
		  Ucp2−/− mice was a striking resistance to infectious
		  microorganisms associated with greater macrophage
		  phagocytic activity and free radical production (9). We
		  showed that macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice produced
		  reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the nitro blue
		  tetrazolium reduction assay and hypothesized that UCP2
		  plays a role in host immune defense by regulating the
		  production of ROS. A broad definition of ROS can include
		  reactive oxygen as well as nitrogen species, and
		  macrophages are known to generate reactive nitrogen species
		  (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) in addition to superoxide.
		  However, the nitro blue tetrazolium assay cannot
		  distinguish between the ROS and RNS generated (12) or the
		  mechanisms responsible for it. In the present study we
		  explored the molecular basis of this amplified immune
		  response in Ucp2−/− mice using lipopolysaccharide
		  (LPS), a membrane glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria that
		  is a well-established activator of both the “reactive
		  oxygen” and “reactive nitrogen” generating pathways
		  (13, 14). We show that in response to LPS challenge,
		  Ucp2−/− mice produce large amounts of nitric oxide and
		  cytokines both in vivo and from isolated macrophages in
		  vitro as compared with wild-type mice. As one of the major
		  transcription factors responsible for increasing the
		  expression of iNOS and inflammatory cytokines, we find that
		  in spleen or isolated macrophages of Ucp2−/− mice, the
		  NF-$\kappa$B system is activated at several steps in its
		  pathway (importantly, even under basal conditions).
		  NF-$\kappa$B is most frequently composed of two DNA-binding
		  subunits, p50 and p65, which exist as an inactive form in
		  the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory protein (I$\kappa$B).
		  Almost all of the signals that lead to activation of
		  NF-$\kappa$B converge on I$\kappa$B kinase (IKK).
		  Activation of IKK leads to the phosphorylation of
		  I$\kappa$Bs, which targets them for ubiquitination and
		  degradation, thus allowing the NF-$\kappa$B dimer to
		  translocate to the nucleus to regulate target gene
		  expression (15). In the present study we show that IKK
		  activity is elevated in spleen as well as isolated
		  macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice, even under basal
		  conditions, and isolated mitochondria from Ucp2−/−
		  spleen produce significantly more hydrogen peroxide as
		  compared with wild-type mice. Together with the finding
		  that cell-permeable preparations of the ROS inhibitors
		  superoxide dismutase and catalase could block the basal
		  elevation of IKK activity in isolated macrophages, our
		  results support the idea that deficiency of UCP2 results in
		  greater equation M1 release from mitochondria (16), leading
		  in turn to persistent activation of NF-$\kappa$B and
		  exacerbation of subsequent inflammatory challenges.},

		  alterations in the vascular endothelium that are associated

  abstract	= {Almost since Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the x-ray in
		  1896, there has been interest in the use of radiation as
		  treatment for malignant disease, including cancers of the
		  head and neck. e ability of radiotherapy to reduce and
		  sometimes eradicate cancer was appreciated in the early
		  years of experimentation with the new modality. e use of
		  radia- tion therapy for treatment of cancer of the head and
		  neck was of particular interest because of the frequent
		  morbidity of sur- gical resection of head and neck cancer
		  with the frequent del- eterious e ects on speech and
		  swallowing function as well as cosmesis associated with
		  surgical resection. After many years of improving
		  radiotherapy delivery methods and dose sched- ules, the
		  approach remains attractive today and is frequently
		  preferred, allowing for preservation of speech and swallow-
		  ing function with eradication of disease in many cases. e
		  modality has evolved through the years with the develop-
		  ment of high-energy radiation machines capable of sparing
		  super cial normal tissues; the development of e ective
		  radio- isotopes for interstitial and intracavitary
		  applications; the appreciation of biologic di erences
		  between normal tissues and tumors relative to response to
		  radiation, allowing more optimal radiation dose schedules;
		  the integration of systemic therapies with radiation; and
		  the complex delivery of radio- therapy from multiple

		  the mechanism of this effect, we produced Tbeta4 mutants
		  with impaired functional motifs and tested their
		  intracellular location and activity. Cytoplasmic
		  distributions of Tbeta4((AcSDKPT/4A)),
		  Tbeta4((KLKKTET/7A)), and Tbeta4((K16A)) mutants fused with
		  green fluorescent protein did not differ significantly from
		  those of wild-type Tbeta4. Overexpression of Tbeta4,
		  Tbeta4((AcSDKPT/4A)), and Tbeta4((K16A)) affected
		  intracellular formation of actin filaments. As expected,
		  Tbeta4((K16A)) uptake by nuclei was impaired. On the other
		  hand, overexpression of Tbeta4((KLKKTET/7A)) resulted in
		  developing the actin filament network typical of adhering
		  cells, indicating that the mutant lacked the actin binding
		  site. The mechanism by which intracellular Tbeta4 induced
		  the PAI-1 gene did not depend upon the N-terminal
		  tetrapeptide AcSDKP and depended only partially on its
		  ability to bind G-actin or enter the nucleus. Both Tbeta4
		  and Tbeta4((AcSDKPT/4A)) induced the PAI-1 gene to the same
		  extent, whereas mutants Tbeta4((KLKKTET/7A)) and
		  Tbeta4((K16A)) retained about 60{\%} of the original
		  activity. By proteomic analysis, the Ku80 subunit of
		  ATP-dependent DNA helicase II was found to be associated
		  with Tbeta4. Ku80 and Tbeta4 consistently
		  co-immunoprecipitated in a complex from endothelial cells.
		  Co-transfection of endothelial cells with the Ku80 deletion
		  mutants and Tbeta4 showed that the C-terminal arm domain of
		  Ku80 is directly involved in this interaction. Furthermore,
		  down-regulation of Ku80 by specific short interference RNA
		  resulted in dramatic reduction in PAI-1 expression at the

@Article{	  benhar2001,
  abstract	= {Many primary tumors as well as transformed cell lines
		  display high sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and
		  radiation. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this
		  sensitivity are largely unknown. Here we show that the
		  sensitization of transformed cells to stress stimuli is due
		  to the potentiation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
		  and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.
		  Activation of these pathways by the antitumor drug
		  cis-platin (CDDP) and by other stress agents is markedly
		  enhanced and is induced by lower stress doses in NIH 3T3
		  cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor,
		  HER1–2 kinase, or oncogenic Ras than in nontransformed
		  NIH 3T3 cells. Inhibition of stress kinase activity by
		  specific inhibitors reduces CDDP-mediated cell death in
		  transformed cells, whereas overactivation of stress kinase
		  pathways augments cells death. Potentiation of stress
		  kinases is a common feature of cells transformed by
		  different oncogenes, including cells derived from human
		  tumors, and is shown here to be independent of the activity
		  of the particular transforming oncoprotein. We further show
		  that the mechanism that underlies potentiation of stress
		  kinases in transformed cells involves reactive oxygen
		  species (ROS), whose production is elevated in these cells.
		  JNK/p38 activation is inhibited by antioxidants and in
		  particular by inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory
		  chain and NADPH oxidase. Conversely, by artificially
		  elevating ROS levels in nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells we
		  were able to induce potentiation of JNK/p38 activation.
		  Taken together, our findings suggest that ROS-dependent
		  potentiation of stress kinase pathways accounts for the
		  sensitization of transformed cells to stress and anticancer
		  drugs. The expression of oncogenes or the enhanced activity
		  of proto-oncogenes induces unregulated mitosis and cell
		  proliferation in most cell types. Conversely, oncogenic
		  transformation often results in the apparently
		  contradictory phenomenon of sensitization to stress-induced
		  apoptosis. For example, rat embryo fibroblasts transformed
		  by the oncogenic forms of Myc, Mos, Src, or Ras are
		  sensitized to induction of apoptosis by the antitumor drug
		  cis-platin (CDDP) (4). Similarly, transformation of NIH 3T3
		  cells by oncogenic Src, Ras, or Raf potentiates apoptosis
		  in response to treatment with etoposide (11). In several
		  cases, overexpression of the epidermal growth factor
		  receptor (EGFR) or the related HER-2/neu receptor was found
		  to be associated with enhanced sensitivity to CDDP (3, 19).
		  In fact, the enhanced sensitivity of oncogenically
		  transformed cells to these agents forms the basis of
		  present cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, although the
		  enhanced sensitivity of transformed cells is well
		  documented and is of great advantage in the clinic, its
		  molecular basis is not clear. Elucidation of the basis for
		  sensitization of transformed cells to stress is important,
		  since it may further promote our understanding as to why
		  cells from advanced tumors or from tumors that were exposed
		  to chronic chemotherapy often lose this sensitivity and
		  become resistant to apoptotic signals. The
		  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins
		  belongs to distinct and evolutionarily conserved signal
		  transduction pathways that are activated by extracellular
		  stimuli (33, 37, 49). In particular, c-Jun N-terminal
		  kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK (also referred to as
		  stress-activated protein kinases) pathways are activated by
		  stress agents, including tumor necrosis factor alpha,
		  interleukin 1, heat shock, UV light, gamma radiation, and
		  chemotherapeutic drugs (27, 31, 34, 42, 47, 49). This
		  activation has been shown to correlate with induction of
		  apoptosis by these agents. Studies using dominant negative
		  mutants of JNK and p38 and specific pharmacological
		  inhibitors have shown that JNK and/or p38 activation is
		  necessary for UV-, cytokine-, chemotherapy-, ceramide-, and
		  serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (6, 7, 13, 14, 32, 53,
		  57). Also, studies on fibroblasts with targeted disruptions
		  of all the functional Jnk genes established an essential
		  role for JNK in UV-induced and other stress-induced
		  apoptosis (50). However, it is not known how oncogenic
		  transformation affects the stress kinase pathways. In view
		  of the important role of JNK and p38 MAPKs in the cellular
		  response to stress, we sought to compare the activation and
		  regulation of these pathways in transformed cells and in
		  nontransformed cells. Here we show that JNK and p38
		  expression and activity are similar in transformed and
		  nontransformed cell lines under normal growth conditions.
		  Under stress, however, JNK and p38 activation are greatly
		  enhanced in transformed NIH 3T3 cells. For transformed
		  cells, low doses of stress stimuli are sufficient to induce
		  JNK/p38 activation and consequently cell death. We further
		  show that stress kinase potentiation in transformed cells
		  is due to an elevated rate of production of reactive oxygen
		  species (ROS). We propose that the ROS-mediated JNK and p38
		  activation play a key role in the sensitization of
		  oncogenically transformed cells to stress signals and to
		  anticancer drugs.},

		  Results: Significant benefit in locoregional tumor control
		  from continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy
		  was seen in patients with HNSCC with high EGFR expression
		  (2P = .010) but not in those with low EGFR expression (2P =
		  .85). EGFR status had no significant effect on survival or
		  rate of distant metastases. The EGFR index was
		  significantly associated with histologic grade and

  abstract	= {Genome regulatory proteins (e.g., repressors or
		  polymerases) that function by binding to specific
		  chromosomal target base pair sequences (e.g., operators or
		  promoters) can appear to arrive at their targets at faster
		  than diffusion-controlled rates. These proteins also
		  exhibit appreciable affinity for nonspecific DNA, and thus
		  this apparently facilitated binding rate must be
		  interpreted in terms of a two-step binding mechanism. The
		  first step involves free diffusion to any nonspecific
		  binding site on the DNA, and the second step comprises a
		  series of protein translocation events that are also driven
		  by thermal fluctuations. Because of nonspecific binding,
		  the search process in the second step is of reduced
		  dimensionality (or volume); this results in an accelerated
		  apparent rate of target location. In this paper we define
		  four types of processes that may be involved in these
		  protein translocation events between DNA sites. These are
		  (i) "macroscopic" dissociation--reassociation processes
		  within the domain of the DNA molecule, (ii) "microscopic"
		  dissociation--reassociation events between closely spaced
		  sites in the DNA molecule, (iii) "intersegment transfer"
		  (via "ring-closure") processes between different segments
		  of the DNA molecule, and (iv) "sliding" along the DNA
		  molecule. We present mathematical and physical descriptions
		  of each of these processes, and the consequences of each
		  for the overall rate of target location are worked out as a
		  function of both the nonspecific binding affinity between
		  protein and DNA and the length of the DNA molecule
		  containing the target sequence. The theory is developed in
		  terms of the Escherichia coli lac repressor--operator
		  interaction since data for testing these approaches are
		  available for this system [Barkley, M. (1981) Biochemistry

		  Biochemistry (third paper of three in this issue)].
		  However, we emphasize that this approach is general for the

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Cytogenetic and gene expression analyses in
		  head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have allowed
		  identification of genomic aberrations that may contribute
		  to cancer pathophysiology. Nevertheless, the molecular
		  consequences of numerous genetic alterations still remain
		  unclear.
		  
		  METHODS: To identify novel genes implicated in HNSCC
		  pathogenesis, we analyzed the genomic alterations present
		  in five HNSCC-derived cell lines by array CGH, and compared
		  high level focal gene amplifications with gene expression
		  levels to identify genes whose expression is directly
		  impacted by these genetic events. Next, we knocked down
		  TRPC6, one of the most highly amplified and over-expressed
		  genes, to characterize the biological roles of TRPC6 in
		  carcinogenesis. Finally, real time PCR was performed to
		  determine TRPC6 gene dosage and mRNA levels in normal
		  mucosa and human HNSCC tissues.
		  
		  RESULTS: The data showed that the HNSCC-derived cell lines
		  carry most of the recurrent genomic abnormalities
		  previously described in primary tumors. High-level genomic
		  amplifications were found at four chromosomal sites
		  (11q21-q22.2, 18p11.31-p11.21, 19p13.2-p13.13, and 21q11)
		  with associated gene expression changes in selective
		  candidate genes suggesting that they may play an important
		  role in the malignant behavior of HNSCC. One of the most
		  dramatic alterations of gene transcription involved the
		  TRPC6 gene (located at 11q21-q22.2) which has been recently
		  implicated in tumour invasiveness. siRNA-induced knockdown
		  of TRPC6 expression in HNSCC-derived cells dramatically
		  inhibited HNSCC-cell invasion but did not significantly
		  alter cell proliferation. Importantly, amplification and
		  concomitant overexpression of TRPC6 was also found in HNSCC
		  tumour samples.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data show that TRPC6 is
		  likely to be a target for 11q21-22.2 amplification that
		  confers enhanced invasive behavior to HNSCC cells.
		  Therefore, TRPC6 may be a promising therapeutic target in
		  the treatment of HNSCC.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Local or regional lymph node recurrence is the
		  most common pattern of treatment failure in oral squamous
		  cell carcinoma (SCC). The local recurrence rate is 30{\%}
		  even when the surgical resection margin is diagnosed as
		  tumour free. Accumulation of genetic changes in
		  histologically normal epithelium in the surgical resection
		  margin may explain the local recurrence rate. The purpose
		  of this study is to investigate the presence of senescence
		  markers, which may represent early malignant changes in the
		  margin that in routine pathological evaluations are
		  classified as histologically normal. METHODS:
		  Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from
		  16 consecutive patients with oral SCC and a clear surgical
		  margin were obtained. The margin was analysed by
		  immunohistochemistry for p53, p16, Chk2, Laminin-5 and
		  glycosylated oncofetal fibronectin. RESULTS: Two patterns
		  of p53 expression were found in the histologically normal
		  epithelium in the surgical resection margin. One was
		  characterized by no protein expression in the majority of
		  cells, except for small clusters of basal and parabasal
		  cells with nuclear staining. The other was characterized by
		  p53 expression in the nuclei of most basal cells. The
		  expression of p16 was confined to small groups of cells in
		  the basal cell layer whereas Chk2 was only seen in one
		  case. Upregulation of the stromal proteins, Laminin-5 or
		  glycosylated oncofetal fibronectin, was only seen at
		  regions of invasion. CONCLUSION: Small groups of cells
		  expressing p53 and p16 were found in the surgical resection
		  margin that appeared to be histologically normal and may
		  represent early malignant changes.},

		  535 patients with primary treatment-na{\"{i}}ve oral cavity
		  squamous cell carcinomas were identified. The median
		  survival follow-up time was 48 months (range 0–125
		  months) after treatment. The median five-year overall
		  survival was found to be 47{\%}. Median five-year
		  disease-specific survival was 52{\%}, ranging from 80{\%}
		  for stage I to 33{\%} for stage IV patients. For patients
		  given treatment with curative intent, the overall survival
		  was found to be 56{\%} and disease-specific survival
		  62{\%}. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range
		  24–101 years), 64 years for men and 72 years for women.
		  The male: female ratio was 1.2. No gender difference was
		  found in neither tumor status (p = 0.180) nor node status

		  Methods Five randomized trials representing 1,772 patients
		  were identified. Updated individual patient data (IPD) were

		  trial, was used for comparison. Interaction or trend tests
		  were used to study the interaction between covariates and
		  treatment. Results Median follow-up was 4.9 years. The
		  hazard ratio (HR) of death was 0.79 (95{\%} CI, 0.70 to
		  0.89; P {\textless} .001; absolute benefit at 5 years:
		  7.4{\%}) in favor of Tax-PF. Heterogeneity was significant
		  (P = .08, I2 {\textless} 51{\%}) and related to one trial.
		  There was no more heterogeneity after exclusion of this
		  trial (P {\textless} .99, I2 = 0{\%}), and HR of death was

		  antiretroviral (ARV) era in a nontuberculosis endemic
		  setting. METHODS: A multicentred, retrospective cohort
		  study of peripheral lymph node biopsies in HIV-positive
		  adults was carried out. A total of 107 charts were
		  identified and reviewed for clinical features,
		  lymphadenopathy size, and ARV use and duration. Biopsy
		  results were categorized, and multivariate logistic
		  regression determined independent predictors of
		  lymphadenopathy aetiology. RESULTS: Evaluation of 107
		  peripheral lymph node biopsies revealed that 42.9{\%} of
		  peripheral lymphadenopathy was attributable to malignancy,
		  49.5{\%} to reactive changes, and 7.5{\%} to infections,
		  with only 2.8{\%} of all cases secondary to tuberculosis.
		  Fevers, weight loss, ARV use, and lower viral loads are
		  significantly associated with nonreactive lymphadenopathy.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Lymphadenopathy is likely to be reactive or
		  malignant in nontuberculosis endemic regions. Readily
		  available clinical features can aid clinicians in
		  predicting the underlying aetiology, those at risk for
		  malignancy, and who to biopsy.},

		  growth factor receptor, in the treatment of locoregionally
		  advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
		  METHODS: Patients with locoregionally advanced head and
		  neck cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with
		  high-dose radiotherapy alone (213 patients) or high-dose
		  radiotherapy plus weekly cetuximab (211 patients) at an
		  initial dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface
		  area, followed by 250 mg per square meter weekly for the
		  duration of radiotherapy. The primary end point was the
		  duration of control of locoregional disease; secondary end
		  points were overall survival, progression-free survival,
		  the response rate, and safety. RESULTS: The median duration
		  of locoregional control was 24.4 months among patients
		  treated with cetuximab plus radiotherapy and 14.9 months
		  among those given radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for
		  locoregional progression or death, 0.68; P = 0.005). With a
		  median follow-up of 54.0 months, the median duration of
		  overall survival was 49.0 months among patients treated
		  with combined therapy and 29.3 months among those treated
		  with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.74; P =
		  0.03). Radiotherapy plus cetuximab significantly prolonged
		  progression-free survival (hazard ratio for disease
		  progression or death, 0.70; P = 0.006). With the exception
		  of acneiform rash and infusion reactions, the incidence of
		  grade 3 or greater toxic effects, including mucositis, did
		  not differ significantly between the two groups.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of locoregionally advanced head and
		  neck cancer with concomitant highdose radiotherapy plus
		  cetuximab improves locoregional control and reduces
		  mortality without increasing the common toxic effects
		  associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck.

  abstract	= {Here we used the Met-1 cell line in an orthotopic
		  transplantation model in FVB/N mice to dissect the role of
		  the Cav-1(P132L) mutation in human breast cancer. Identical
		  experiments were performed in parallel with wild-type
		  Cav-1. Cav-1(P132L) up-regulated the expression of estrogen
		  receptor-alpha as predicted, because only estrogen
		  receptor-alpha-positive patients have been shown to harbor
		  Cav-1(P132L) mutations. In the context of primary tumor
		  formation, Cav-1(P132L) behaved as a loss-of-function
		  mutation, lacking any tumor suppressor activity. In
		  contrast, Cav-1(P132L) caused significant increases in cell
		  migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis,
		  consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. To identify
		  possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this invasive
		  gain-of-function activity, we performed unbiased gene
		  expression profiling. From this analysis, we show that the
		  Cav-1(P132L) expression signature contains numerous genes
		  that have been previously associated with cell migration,
		  invasion, and metastasis. These include i) secreted growth
		  factors and extracellular matrix proteins (Cyr61, Plf,
		  Pthlh, Serpinb5, Tnc, and Wnt10a), ii) proteases that
		  generate EGF and HGF (Adamts1 and St14), and iii) tyrosine
		  kinase substrates and integrin signaling/adapter proteins
		  (Akap13, Cdcp1, Ddef1, Eps15, Foxf1a, Gab2, Hs2st1, and
		  Itgb4). Several of the P132L-specific genes are also highly
		  expressed in stem/progenitor cells or are associated with
		  myoepithelial cells, suggestive of an
		  epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results directly
		  support clinical data showing that patients harboring Cav-1
		  mutations are more likely to undergo recurrence and

  abstract	= {REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is
		  to identify the effectiveness of mindfulness based programs
		  in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult
		  hospitalized patient care settings. BACKGROUND: Nursing
		  professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical
		  environment. Many of these stressors have always been
		  inherent to the profession: long work hours, dealing with
		  pain, loss and emotional suffering, caring for dying
		  patients and providing support to families. Recently nurses
		  have been experiencing increased stress related to other
		  factors such as staffing shortages, increasingly complex
		  patients, corporate financial constraints and the increased
		  need for knowledge of ever-changing technology. Stress
		  affects high-level cognitive functions, specifically
		  attention and memory, and this increases the already high
		  stakes for nurses. Nurses are required to cope with very
		  difficult situations that require accurate, timely
		  decisions that affect human lives on a daily basis.Lapses
		  in attention increase the risk of serious consequences such
		  as medication errors, failure to recognize life-threatening
		  signs and symptoms, and other essential patient safety
		  issues. Research has also shown that the stress inherent to
		  health care occupations can lead to depression, reduced job
		  satisfaction, psychological distress and disruptions to
		  personal relationships. These outcomes of stress are
		  factors that create scenarios for risk of patient
		  harm.There are three main effects of stress on nurses:
		  burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been
		  defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional
		  exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and
		  the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to
		  perceived stress. Shimizu, Mizoue, Mishima and Nagata state
		  that nurses experience considerable job stress which has
		  been a major factor in the high rates of burnout that has
		  been recorded among nurses. Zangaro and Soeken share this
		  opinion and state that work related stress is largely
		  contributing to the current nursing shortage. They report
		  that work stress leads to a much higher turnover,
		  especially during the first year after graduation, lowering
		  retention rates in general.In a study conducted in
		  Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43{\%} of the
		  nurses who reported high levels of burnout indicated their
		  intent to leave their current position, only 11{\%} of
		  nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the
		  following 12 months. In the same study patient-to-nurse
		  ratios were significantly associated with emotional
		  exhaustion and burnout. An increase of one patient per
		  nurse assignment to a hospital's staffing level increased
		  burnout by 23{\%}.Depression can be defined as a mood
		  disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and
		  loss of interest. Wang found that high levels of work
		  stress were associated with higher risk of mood and anxiety
		  disorders. In Canada one out of every 10 nurses have shown
		  depressive symptoms; compared to the average of 5.1{\%} of
		  the nurses' counterparts who do not work in healthcare.
		  High incidences of depression and depressive symptoms were
		  also reported in studies among Chinese nurses (38{\%}) and
		  Taiwanese nurses (27.7{\%}). In the Taiwanese study the
		  occurrence of depression was significantly and positively
		  correlated to job stress experienced by the nurses
		  (p{\textless}0.001).In a multivariate logistic regression,
		  Ohler, Kerr and Forbes also found that job stress was
		  significantly correlated to depression in nurses. The
		  researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher
		  degree of job stress were 80{\%} more likely to have
		  suffered a major depressive episode in the previous year. A
		  further finding in this study revealed that 75{\%} of the
		  participants also suffered from at least one chronic
		  disease revealing a strong association between depression
		  and other major health issues.A stressful working
		  environment, such as a hospital, could potentially lead to
		  lateral violence among nurses. Lateral violence is a
		  serious occupational health concern among nurses as
		  evidenced by extensive research and literature available on
		  the topic. The impact of lateral violence has been well
		  studied and documented over the past three decades. Griffin
		  and Clark state that lateral violence is a form of bullying
		  grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression
		  theory. The bullying behaviors occur among members of an
		  oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having
		  a perceived lack of control in their workplace. Griffin
		  identified the ten most common forms of lateral violence
		  among nurses as "non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront,
		  undermining activities, withholding information, sabotage,
		  infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect
		  privacy, and broken confidences". Nurse-to-nurse lateral
		  violence leads to negative workplace relationships and
		  disrupts team performance, creating an environment where
		  poor patient outcomes, burnout and high staff turnover
		  rates are prevalent.Work-related stressors have been
		  indicated as a potential cause of lateral violence.
		  According to the Effort Reward Imbalance model (ERI)
		  developed by Siegrist, work stress develops when an
		  imbalance exists between the effort individuals put into
		  their jobs and the rewards they receive in return. The ERI
		  model has been widely used in occupational health settings
		  based on its predictive power for adverse health and
		  well-being outcomes. The model claims that both high
		  efforts with low rewards could lead to negative emotions in
		  the exposed employees. Vegchel, van Jonge, de Bosma {\&}
		  Schaufeli state that, according to the ERI model,
		  occupational rewards mostly consist of money, esteem and
		  job security or career opportunities. A survey conducted by
		  Reineck {\&} Furino indicated that registered nurses had a
		  very high regard for the intrinsic rewards of their
		  profession but that they identified workplace relationships
		  and stress issues as some of the most important
		  contributors to their frustration and exhaustion. Hauge,
		  Skogstad {\&} Einarsen state that work-related stress
		  further increases the potential for lateral violence as it
		  creates a negative environment for both the target and the
		  perpetrator.Mindfulness based programs have proven to be a
		  promising intervention in reducing stress experienced by
		  nurses. Mindfulness was originally defined by Jon
		  Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as "paying attention on purpose, in the
		  present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of
		  experience moment to moment". The Mindfulness Based Stress
		  Reduction (MBSR) program is an educationally based program
		  that focuses on training in the contemplative practice of
		  mindfulness. It is an eight-week program where participants
		  meet weekly for two-and-a-half hours and join a one-day
		  long retreat for six hours. The program incorporates a
		  combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness and
		  yoga to help increase mindfulness in participants. The
		  practice is meant to facilitate relaxation in the body and
		  calming of the mind by focusing on present-moment
		  awareness. The program has proven to be effective in
		  reducing stress, improving quality of life and increasing
		  self-compassion in healthcare professionals.Researchers
		  have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions can
		  effectively reduce stress, anxiety and depression in both
		  clinical and non-clinical populations. In a meta-analysis
		  of seven studies conducted with healthy participants from
		  the general public, the reviewers reported a significant
		  reduction in stress when the treatment and control groups
		  were compared. However, there have been limited studies to
		  date that focused specifically on the effectiveness of
		  mindfulness programs to reduce stress experienced by
		  nurses.In addition to stress reduction, mindfulness based
		  interventions can also enhance nurses' capacity for focused
		  attention and concentration by increasing present moment
		  awareness. Mindfulness techniques can be applied in
		  everyday situations as well as stressful situations.
		  According to Kabat-Zinn, work-related stress influences
		  people differently based on their viewpoint and their
		  interpretation of the situation. He states that individuals
		  need to be able to see the whole picture, have perspective
		  on the connectivity of all things and not operate on
		  automatic pilot to effectively cope with stress. The goal
		  of mindfulness meditation is to empower individuals to
		  respond to situations consciously rather than
		  automatically.Prior to the commencement of this systematic
		  review, the Cochrane Library and JBI Database of Systematic
		  Reviews and Implementation Reports were searched. No
		  previous systematic reviews on the topic of reducing stress
		  experienced by nurses through mindfulness programs were
		  identified. Hence, the objective of this systematic review
		  is to evaluate the best research evidence available
		  pertaining to mindfulness-based programs and their
		  effectiveness in reducing perceived stress among nurses.},

  abstract	= {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported in various
		  cancers, including in skin squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC).
		  The molecular mechanisms regulating tumour initiation and
		  stemness are still poorly characterized. Here we find that
		  Sox2, a transcription factor expressed in various types of
		  embryonic and adult stem cells, was the most upregulated
		  transcription factor in the CSCs of squamous skin tumours
		  in mice. SOX2 is absent in normal epidermis but begins to
		  be expressed in the vast majority of mouse and human
		  pre-neoplastic skin tumours, and continues to be expressed
		  in a heterogeneous manner in invasive mouse and human SCCs.
		  In contrast to other SCCs, in which SOX2 is frequently
		  genetically amplified, the expression of SOX2 in mouse and
		  human skin SCCs is transcriptionally regulated. Conditional
		  deletion of Sox2 in the mouse epidermis markedly decreases
		  skin tumour formation after chemical-induced
		  carcinogenesis. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a
		  reporter of Sox2 transcriptional expression (SOX2-GFP
		  knock-in mice), we showed that SOX2-expressing cells in
		  invasive SCC are greatly enriched in tumour-propagating
		  cells, which further increase upon serial transplantations.
		  Lineage ablation of SOX2-expressing cells within primary
		  benign and malignant SCCs leads to tumour regression,
		  consistent with the critical role of SOX2-expressing cells
		  in tumour maintenance. Conditional Sox2 deletion in
		  pre-existing skin papilloma and SCC leads to tumour
		  regression and decreases the ability of cancer cells to be
		  propagated upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice,
		  supporting the essential role of SOX2 in regulating CSC
		  functions. Transcriptional profiling of SOX2-GFP-expressing
		  CSCs and of tumour epithelial cells upon Sox2 deletion
		  uncovered a gene network regulated by SOX2 in primary
		  tumour cells in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
		  identified several direct SOX2 target genes controlling
		  tumour stemness, survival, proliferation, adhesion,
		  invasion and paraneoplastic syndrome. We demonstrate that
		  SOX2, by marking and regulating the functions of skin
		  tumour-initiating cells and CSCs, establishes a continuum
		  between tumour initiation and progression in primary skin
		  tumours.},

@Article{	  brahme2003,
  abstract	= {PET-CT is probably the ultimate tool for accurate tumor
		  imaging and 3-dimensional in vivo predictive assay of
		  radiation sensitivity. By imaging the tumor twice during
		  the early course of therapy, it should be possible to
		  quantify both the tumor responsiveness to therapy and the
		  rate of loss of functional tumor cells using the presently
		  derived equations. This new information is ideal for use
		  together with biologically based therapy optimization and
		  makes it possible accurately to quantitate the
		  dose-response relation, at least for the bulk of the tumor
		  cells. Since the tumor responsiveness is available after
		  about one and a half weeks of therapy, the information is
		  also ideal for use with adaptive therapy where all forms of
		  deviations from the original treatment plan can be
		  accurately corrected for since they generally influence the
		  still functional, but mainly doomed tumor cell compartment.
		  Thus, uncertainties such as: 1) the geometric misalignment
		  of the therapeutic beam with the tumor, 2) deviations of
		  the delivered dose distribution from the planned delivery
		  whether due to 3) an erroneous treatment planning algorithm
		  or 4) treatment equipment uncertainties and 5) deviations
		  in the anticipated responsiveness of the tumor of the
		  patient based on historical response data, can all be taken
		  into account. Fortunately, when a larger tumor cell
		  compartment than expected is seen an increased dose during
		  the remainder of the treatment should always be delivered
		  independently on whichever combination of the above
		  deviations was the true reason. With high-energy photon and
		  hadron therapy it is even possible to image the integral
		  dose delivery in vivo during or after a treatment using
		  PET-CT imaging. The high-energy photons above about 20 MeV
		  produce positron emitters through photonuclear reactions in
		  tissue which are proportional to the photon fluence and
		  thus approximately also to the absorbed dose. Light ion
		  beams, the ultimate radiation modality with regard to
		  physical and biological selectivity, instead produce PET
		  emitters through direct nuclear interactions in tissue, but
		  can also be used as radioactive beams consisting of
		  intrinsic PET emitters such as 8B, 11C, 13N and 15O. These
		  radioactive beams allow more accurate imaging of the Bragg
		  peak distribution and thus indirectly the absorbed dose.
		  The most universal feedback for adaptive radiation therapy
		  would then be to use the measured image of mean dose
		  delivery during the early part of the treatment while
		  revising the treatment plan based on the initially planned
		  dose distribution and the radiation responsiveness of the
		  tumor as seen after the first week or two of therapy. By
		  this so-called BIO-ART approach (Biologically Optimized 3D
		  in vivo predictive Assay-based Radiation Therapy) radiation
		  therapy optimization may become an almost exact science,
		  where the patient's true individual radiation response,
		  considering hypoxia and general radiation resistance as
		  well as possible dose delivery and planning errors, is
		  taken into account.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Half of the patients with head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be expected to fail
		  therapy, indicating that more aggressive treatment is
		  warranted for this group. We have developed a novel risk
		  model that can become a basis for developing new treatment
		  paradigms. Here we report on the performance of our model
		  in a new multicenter cohort. DESIGN: Eligible patients from
		  3 institutions (Montefiore Medical Center, University of
		  Manitoba, and New York University Medical Center) were
		  identified and pathology slides from their resection
		  specimens were reviewed by Margaret Brandwein-Gensler; risk
		  category was assigned as previously published. Kaplan-Meier
		  analysis was performed for disease progression and
		  survival. Cox proportional hazards regression was
		  performed, adjusted for potential confounders. A teaching
		  module was also developed; attending pathologists were
		  asked to score coded slides after a lecture and multiheaded
		  microscope teaching session. Agreement was assessed by
		  calculating Cohen unweighted $\kappa$ coefficients. RESULT:
		  The validation cohort consisted of 305 patients, from the
		  above institutions, with 311 primary HNSCC of the oral
		  cavity, oropharynx, and larynx. The median follow-up period
		  for all patients was 27 months. Risk category predicts time
		  to disease progression (P=0.0005), locoregional recurrence
		  (P=0.013), and overall survival (P=0.0000) by Kaplan-Meier
		  analysis. High-risk status is significantly associated with
		  decreased time to disease progression, adjusted for
		  clinical confounders (P=0.015, hazard ratio 2.32, 95{\%}
		  confidence interval 1.18-4.58) compared with collapsed
		  intermediate and low-risk groups. We also demonstrate
		  substantial interrater agreement ($\kappa$=0.64), and very
		  good rater agreement when compared with the standard
		  ($\kappa$=0.87). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate significant
		  predictive performance of the risk model in a new cohort of
		  patients with primary HNSCC, adjusted for confounders. Our
		  training experience also supports the feasibility of
		  adapting the risk model in clinical practice.

  abstract	= {Although recent studies in vitro and in vivo indicate that
		  the polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) has anti-diabetic
		  properties, the exact mechanisms involved are not known. In
		  the present study, we examined the effects of RSV and the
		  mechanism of regulation of glucose uptake in skeletal
		  muscle cells. In L6 myotubes RSV (100 microM) induced
		  maximum stimulation of glucose (2DG) uptake (201+/-8.90{\%}
		  of control, p{\textless}0.001), an effect that was similar
		  to insulin action. RSV-stimulated glucose uptake was
		  abolished by AMPK inhibition. In the presence of the
		  sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, RSV-stimulated 2DG uptake
		  and AMPK phosphorylation were abolished. RSV did not
		  stimulate significant translocation of GLUT4 or GLUT1
		  transporters. However, treatment with indinavir, a GLUT4
		  specific inhibitor, blocked RSV-stimulated glucos e uptake.
		  We propose that RSV elevates glucose uptake in muscle cells
		  through a mechanism that involves sirtuins and AMPK and
		  possibly stimulation of GLUT4 transporter intrinsic
		  activity.=== == AMPK is an important energy sensor in
		  mammalian cells [4]. In skeletal muscle cells AMPK may be

		  the treatment of type 2 diabetes, have been shown to
		  increase glucose uptake via AMPK. Our studies showed a
		  rapid and significant increase in AMPK phosphorylation by
		  RSV in agreement with other recent studies in hepatocytes
		  [23] and C2C12 mouse muscle cells [12]. Using compound C,
		  an inhibitor of AMPK, we demonstrated a significant
		  reduction in RSV-stimulated glucose uptake providing
		  support of the notion that AMPK is a mediator of the RSV
		  effects on glucose uptake. We measured phosphorylation
		  levels of mTOR, the downstream target of AMPK, and also p70
		  S6K, which is downstream of mTOR [29]. Activated AMPK
		  results in inhibition of mTOR [19]. Our data show that RSV
		  inhibited the phosphorylation of both mTOR and its
		  downstream target p70 S6K. mTOR is also downstream of Akt
		  [19]. However we did not see any changes in Akt
		  phosphorylation with RSV.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Surgical oncologists rely heavily on the
		  histopathological assessment of surgical margins to ensure
		  total excision of the tumor in patients with head and neck
		  cancer. However, current techniques may not detect small
		  numbers of cancer cells at the margins of resection or in
		  cervical lymph nodes. METHODS: We used molecular techniques
		  to determine whether clonal populations of infiltrating
		  tumor cells harboring mutations of the p53 gene could be
		  detected in histopathologically negative surgical margins
		  and cervical lymph nodes of patients with squamous-cell
		  carcinoma of the head and neck. RESULTS: We identified 25
		  patients with primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the head
		  and neck containing a p53 mutation who appeared to have had
		  complete tumor resection on the basis of a negative
		  histopathological assessment. In 13 of these 25 patients,
		  molecular analysis was positive for a p53 mutation in at
		  least one tumor margin. In 5 of 13 patients with positive
		  margins by this method (38 percent), the carcinoma has
		  recurred locally, as compared with none of 12 patients with
		  negative margins (P = 0.02 by the log-rank test).
		  Furthermore, molecular analysis identified neoplastic cells
		  in 6 of 28 lymph nodes (21 percent) that were initially
		  negative by histopathological assessment. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Among specimens initially believed to be negative by light
		  microscopy, a substantial percentage of the surgical
		  margins and lymph nodes from patients with squamous-cell
		  carcinoma of the head and neck contained p53 mutations
		  specific for the primary tumor. Patients with these
		  positive margins appear to have a substantially increased
		  risk of local recurrence. Molecular analysis of surgical
		  margins and lymph nodes can augment standard
		  histopathological assessment and may improve the prediction
		  of local tumor recurrence.},

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: Hypoxia shifts the balance of cellular energy
		  production toward glycolysis with lactate generation as a
		  by-product. Quantitative bioluminescence imaging allows for
		  the quantitation of lactate concentrations in individual
		  tumors. We assessed the relationship between pretreatment
		  tumor lactate concentrations and subsequent development of
		  metastatic disease in patients with newly diagnosed
		  head-and-neck cancer.
		  
		  METHODS AND MATERIALS: At the time of biopsy of the primary
		  site, a separate specimen was taken and flash-frozen for
		  subsequent quantitation of lactate concentration using a
		  luciferase bioluminescence technique. The two-dimensional
		  spatial distribution of the bioluminescence intensity
		  within the tissue section was registered directly using a
		  microscope and an imaging photon counting system. Photon
		  intensity was converted to distributions of volume-related
		  tissue concentrations (micromol per gram wet weight).
		  Treatment consisted of either surgery and postoperative
		  radiotherapy or primary radiotherapy, based on presenting
		  disease stage and institutional treatment policies. The
		  subsequent development of metastatic disease constituted
		  the primary clinical endpoint.
		  
		  RESULTS: Biopsies obtained from 40 patients were evaluable
		  in 34. The larynx was the most frequent primary site (n =
		  25). Other sites included oropharynx (n = 5), hypopharynx
		  (n = 3), and oral cavity (n = 1). Most patients (74{\%})
		  presented with an advanced stage T3 or T4 primary tumor.
		  Nodal involvement was present in 19 (54{\%}) patients. The
		  median tumor lactate concentration was 7.1 micromol/g.
		  Tumors were classified as having either low or high lactate
		  concentrations according to whether these values were below
		  or above the median. The median follow-up time for
		  surviving patients is 27 months. Two-year actuarial
		  survival was 90{\%} for patients with
		  low-lactate-concentration tumor vs. 35{\%} for patients
		  with high-lactate-concentration primaries
		  ({\textless}0.0001). Two-year metastasis-free survival was
		  adversely influenced by high tumor lactate concentrations
		  (90{\%} vs. 25{\%}, p {\textless} 0.0001). The median
		  lactate concentration for tumors that subsequently
		  metastasized was 12.9 micromol/g vs. 4.8 micromol/g for
		  patients who remained continuously free of disease (p
		  {\textless} 0.005). Lactate concentration was not
		  correlated with presenting T stage or N stage.
		  
		  DISCUSSION: Elevated tumor lactate concentrations are
		  associated with the subsequent development of nodal or
		  distant metastases in head-and-neck cancer patients. This
		  more aggressive malignant phenotype is probably associated
		  with hypoxia-mediated radioresistance and the upregulation
		  of metastasis-associated genes.},

  abstract	= {Improved disease-free survival for oral squamous cell
		  carcinoma (SCC) with the use of postoperative radiotherapy
		  (PORT) has to be balanced against the risk of recurrence,
		  the relative morbidity of radiotherapy, reduced options for
		  treatment, and survival with recurrent disease. In the
		  absence of randomised trials, a review of current evidence
		  is timely because of increasing differences in outcome and
		  response to treatment for cancers of the larynx,
		  oropharynx, and oral cavity. From a search of 109 papers,
		  25 presented relevant data in tabular form, and reported
		  local, regional, and total recurrence, and overall
		  survival. Most data come from non-randomised studies that
		  compared the effects of interventions with previous or
		  historical information. A summary of the results shows
		  local recurrence of 11{\%}, 17{\%}, and 15{\%} for early,
		  late, and all stages after operation alone, compared with
		  13{\%}, 16{\%}, and 19{\%} after PORT. Regional recurrence
		  is reported as 13{\%}, 12{\%}, and 11{\%} for early, late,

		  with 65{\%}, 62{\%}, and 62{\%} for early, late and all
		  stages of oral SCC, respectively. It is acknowledged that
		  this is a weak level of evidence as patients who have PORT
		  probably have a high pathological-stage of disease. Knowing
		  that PORT increases morbidity and reduces salvage rates and
		  options for treating recurrent disease, this difference in
		  overall survival emphasises the need for randomised studies
		  or a re-evaluation of our current protocols.

  abstract	= {Background: Changing population-level exposure to
		  modifiable risk factors is a key driver of changing cancer
		  incidence. Understanding these changes is therefore vital
		  when prioritising risk-reduction policies, in order to have
		  the biggest impact on reducing cancer incidence. UK figures
		  on the number of risk factor-attributable cancers are
		  updated here to reflect changing behaviour as assessed in
		  representative national surveys, and new epidemiological
		  evidence. Figures are also presented by UK constituent
		  country because prevalence of risk factor exposure varies
		  between them. Methods: Population attributable fractions
		  (PAFs) were calculated for combinations of risk factor and
		  cancer type with sufficient/convincing evidence of a causal
		  association. Relative risks (RRs) were drawn from
		  meta-analyses of cohort studies where possible. Prevalence
		  of exposure to risk factors was obtained from nationally
		  representative population surveys. Cancer incidence data
		  for 2015 were sourced from national data releases and,
		  where needed, personal communications. PAF calculations
		  were stratified by age, sex and risk factor exposure level
		  and then combined to create summary PAFs by cancer type,
		  sex and country. Results: Nearly four in ten (37.7{\%})
		  cancer cases in 2015 in the UK were attributable to known
		  risk factors. The proportion was around two percentage
		  points higher in UK males (38.6{\%}) than in UK females
		  (36.8{\%}). Comparing UK countries, the attributable
		  proportion was highest in Scotland (41.5{\%} for persons)
		  and lowest in England (37.3{\%} for persons). Tobacco
		  smoking contributed by far the largest proportion of
		  attributable cancer cases, followed by overweight/obesity,
		  accounting for 15.1{\%} and 6.3{\%}, respectively, of all
		  cases in the UK in 2015. For 10 cancer types, including two
		  of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer
		  and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70{\%} of UK cancer
		  cases were attributable to known risk factors. Conclusion:
		  Tobacco and overweight/obesity remain the top contributors
		  of attributable cancer cases. Tobacco smoking has the
		  highest PAF because it greatly increases cancer risk and
		  has a large number of cancer types associated with it.
		  Overweight/obesity has the second-highest PAF because it
		  affects a high proportion of the UK population and is also
		  linked with many cancer types. Public health policy may
		  seek to mitigate the level of harm associated with exposure
		  or reduce exposure levels - both approaches may effectively
		  impact cancer incidence. Differences in PAFs between
		  countries and sexes are primarily due to varying prevalence
		  of exposure to risk factors and varying proportions of
		  specific cancer types. This variation in turn is affected
		  by socio-demographic differences which drive differences in
		  exposure to theoretically avoidable 'lifestyle' factors.
		  PAFs at UK country level have not been available previously
		  and they should be used by policymakers in devolved
		  nations. PAFs are estimates based on the best available
		  data, limitations in those data would generally bias toward
		  underestimation of PAFs. Regular collection of risk factor
		  exposure prevalence data which corresponds with
		  epidemiological evidence is vital for analyses like this
		  and should remain a priority for the UK Government and
		  devolved Administrations.},

  abstract	= {IMPORTANCE There is controversy surrounding surgical
		  margins in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC),
		  with debate regarding the assessment and prognostic value
		  of margins. OBJECTIVE To analyze a large cohort of OCSCC
		  cases for correlation between tumor specimen margins and
		  intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins and evaluate how
		  margin status associates with local recurrence and
		  survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective
		  cohort study of 406 patients treated with OCSCC resection
		  between 2005 and 2014 at the University of Iowa Hospitals
		  and Clinics. Included cases underwent margin evaluation on
		  the tumor specimen and intraoperative frozen margin
		  assessment from the tumor bed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
		  Findings of intraoperative frozen margin analysis as a test
		  of tumor specimen margins; local recurrence and survival
		  based on margin findings; prognosis based on clearance of
		  positive frozen margins. To evaluate whether additional
		  resection to "clear" positive frozen margins affected
		  prognosis, we compared local recurrence rates for patients
		  in 3 groups: group A included those patients with negative
		  margins on both intraoperative and permanent specimens;
		  group B included those with positive intraoperative margins
		  subsequently cleared by additional resection to negative
		  margins; and group C included those with negative
		  intraoperative but positive permanent specimen margins.
		  RESULTS The median age of the 406 patients (234 men and 172
		  women) was 61 years (interquartile range, 53-72 years).
		  When frozen margins were correlated with tumor specimen
		  margins, frozen margin accuracy was 65{\%}, with a
		  46{\%}false-negative rate.We observed a local recurrence
		  rate of 36{\%}(95{\%}CI, 24{\%}-49{\%}) when invasive
		  carcinoma was present at an intraoperative frozen margin
		  and 45{\%}(95{\%}CI, 34{\%}-57{\%}) when invasive carcinoma
		  was found on the permanent specimen margin compared with
		  19{\%} (95{\%}CI, 14{\%}-26{\%}) and 13{\%} (95{\%}CI,
		  7{\%}-22{\%}) for completely negative frozen and permanent
		  margin findings, respectively. There was a significant
		  difference in local recurrence between group A (13{\%}) and
		  group B (27{\%}) (absolute difference, 14{\%}; 95{\%}CI,
		  3{\%}-26{\%}) and between group A and group C (34{\%})
		  (absolute difference, 21{\%}; 95{\%}CI, 8{\%}-34{\%}), but
		  there was no difference between groups B and C (absolute
		  difference, 7{\%}; 95{\%}CI, -8{\%}to 22{\%}), suggesting
		  that additional resection to clear positive frozen margins
		  does not improve prognosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
		  Intraoperative frozen margins from the tumor bed are not
		  ideal predictors of positive margins on the main specimen.
		  Both frozen and specimen margins are associated with local
		  recurrence, but the specimen margin has the stronger
		  association. Importantly, we demonstrate that clearing
		  positive frozen margins from the tumor bed is not associated with improved outcomes.},

  abstract	= {Objective: To conduct a multivariate analysis of a large
		  cohort of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) cases
		  for independent predictors of local recurrence (LR) and
		  overall survival (OS), with emphasis on the relationship
		  between (1) prognosis and (2) main specimen permanent
		  margins and intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins. Study
		  Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary
		  academic head and neck cancer program. Subjects and
		  Methods: This study included 426 patients treated with
		  OCSCC resection between 2005 and 2014 at University of Iowa
		  Hospitals and Clinics. Patients underwent excision of OCSCC
		  with intraoperative tumor bed frozen margin sampling and
		  main specimen permanent margin assessment. Multivariate
		  analysis of the data set to predict LR and OS was
		  performed. Results: Independent predictors of LR included
		  nodal involvement, histologic grade, and main specimen
		  permanent margin status. Specifically, the presence of a
		  positive margin (odds ratio, 6.21; 95{\%} CI, 3.3-11.9) or
		  {\textless}1-mm/carcinoma in situ margin (odds ratio, 2.41;
		  95{\%} CI, 1.19-4.87) on the main specimen was an

		  bed margins were not predictive of LR on multivariate
		  analysis. Similarly, independent predictors of OS on
		  multivariate analysis included nodal involvement,
		  extracapsular extension, and a positive main specimen
		  margin. Tumor bed margins did not independently predict OS.
		  Conclusion: The main specimen margin is a strong
		  independent predictor of LR and OS on multivariate
		  analysis. Intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins do not
		  independently predict prognosis. We conclude that emphasis
		  should be placed on evaluating the main specimen margins
		  when estimating prognosis after OCSCC resection.},

		  treatment. Currently, there is no standard method or

		  Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of

		  methods for cutoff optimization is based solely on the
		  distribution of the marker under investigation, other
		  methods optimize the correlation of the dichotomization
		  with respect to an outcome or survival variable. We
		  illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the
		  analysis of the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER)
		  and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues.
		  This distribution of these important markers is analyzed
		  and correlated with immunohistologically determined ER
		  status and distant metastasis free survival. Cutoff Finder
		  is expected to fill a relevant gap in the available

		  dilemma in certain cases, despite recent progress in

		  detect the facilitative glucose transporter, GLUT1, in
		  cytologic preparations of body cavity effusions and washes.
		  With the use of standard avidin-biotin immunostaining for
		  GLUT1, we examined cell blocks of body cavity effusions or
		  washings from 31 carcinomas, 1 lymphoma, and 25 benign
		  effusions or washes. GLUT1 staining occurred in the
		  malignant cell population in 29 (93.5{\%}) of 31
		  carcinomatous effusions or washes. The characteristic
		  staining pattern consisted of dense, linear staining of the
		  plasma membrane, with accentuation at cell-cell borders,
		  with or without cytoplasmic staining. Erythrocytes showed
		  positive GLUT1 membrane staining, consistent with previous
		  reports. Of 25 benign effusions, 20 were nonstaining
		  (excepting erythrocytes), and 5 contained rare single
		  mesothelial cells, with equivocal to very weak membrane
		  staining. Staining of these cells was readily
		  distinguishable from the characteristic strong staining of

  abstract	= {Background: Pembrolizumab is active in head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with programmed cell death
		  ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression associated with improved
		  response. Methods: KEYNOTE-048 was a randomised, phase 3
		  study of participants with untreated locally incurable
		  recurrent or metastatic HNSCC done at 200 sites in 37
		  countries. Participants were stratified by PD-L1
		  expression, p16 status, and performance status and randomly
		  allocated (1:1:1) to pembrolizumab alone, pembrolizumab
		  plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (pembrolizumab with
		  chemotherapy), or cetuximab plus a platinum and
		  5-fluorouracil (cetuximab with chemotherapy). Investigators
		  and participants were aware of treatment assignment.
		  Investigators, participants, and representatives of the
		  sponsor were masked to the PD-L1 combined positive score
		  (CPS) results; PD-L1 positivity was not required for study
		  entry. The primary endpoints were overall survival (time
		  from randomisation to death from any cause) and
		  progression-free survival (time from randomisation to
		  radiographically confirmed disease progression or death
		  from any cause, whichever came first) in the
		  intention-to-treat population (all participants randomly
		  allocated to a treatment group). There were 14 primary
		  hypotheses: superiority of pembrolizumab alone and of
		  pembrolizumab with chemotherapy versus cetuximab with
		  chemotherapy for overall survival and progression-free
		  survival in the PD-L1 CPS of 20 or more, CPS of 1 or more,
		  and total populations and non-inferiority (non-inferiority
		  margin: 1{\textperiodcentered}2) of pembrolizumab alone and
		  pembrolizumab with chemotherapy versus cetuximab with
		  chemotherapy for overall survival in the total population.
		  The definitive findings for each hypothesis were obtained
		  when statistical testing was completed for that hypothesis;
		  this occurred at the second interim analysis for 11
		  hypotheses and at final analysis for three hypotheses.
		  Safety was assessed in the as-treated population (all
		  participants who received at least one dose of allocated
		  treatment). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
		  number NCT02358031. Findings: Between April 20, 2015, and
		  Jan 17, 2017, 882 participants were allocated to receive
		  pembrolizumab alone (n=301), pembrolizumab with
		  chemotherapy (n=281), or cetuximab with chemotherapy
		  (n=300); of these, 754 (85{\%}) had CPS of 1 or more and
		  381 (43{\%}) had CPS of 20 or more. At the second interim
		  analysis, pembrolizumab alone improved overall survival
		  versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the CPS of 20 or more
		  population (median 14{\textperiodcentered}9 months vs
		  10{\textperiodcentered}7 months, hazard ratio [HR]
		  0{\textperiodcentered}61 [95{\%} CI
		  0{\textperiodcentered}45–0{\textperiodcentered}83],

		  10{\textperiodcentered}3, 0{\textperiodcentered}78
		  [0{\textperiodcentered}64–0{\textperiodcentered}96],

		  total population (11{\textperiodcentered}6 vs
		  10{\textperiodcentered}7, 0{\textperiodcentered}85
		  [0{\textperiodcentered}71–1{\textperiodcentered}03]).
		  Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved overall survival
		  versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the total population
		  (13{\textperiodcentered}0 months vs
		  10{\textperiodcentered}7 months, HR
		  0{\textperiodcentered}77 [95{\%} CI
		  0{\textperiodcentered}63–0{\textperiodcentered}93],
		  p=0{\textperiodcentered}0034) at the second interim
		  analysis and in the CPS of 20 or more population
		  (14{\textperiodcentered}7 vs 11{\textperiodcentered}0,
		  0{\textperiodcentered}60
		  [0{\textperiodcentered}45–0{\textperiodcentered}82],
		  p=0{\textperiodcentered}0004) and CPS of 1 or more
		  population (13{\textperiodcentered}6 vs
		  10{\textperiodcentered}4, 0{\textperiodcentered}65
		  [0{\textperiodcentered}53–0{\textperiodcentered}80],
		  p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) at final analysis.
		  Neither pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab with
		  chemotherapy improved progression-free survival at the
		  second interim analysis. At final analysis, grade 3 or
		  worse all-cause adverse events occurred in 164 (55{\%}) of
		  300 treated participants in the pembrolizumab alone group,
		  235 (85{\%}) of 276 in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy
		  group, and 239 (83{\%}) of 287 in the cetuximab with

		  (8{\%}) participants in the pembrolizumab alone group, 32
		  (12{\%}) in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group, and
		  28 (10{\%}) in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group.
		  Interpretation: Based on the observed efficacy and safety,
		  pembrolizumab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil is an
		  appropriate first-line treatment for recurrent or

  abstract	= {Besides being the favorite carbon and energy source for
		  the budding yeast Sacchromyces cerevisiae, glucose can act
		  as a signaling molecule to regulate multiple aspects of
		  yeast physiology. Yeast cells have evolved several
		  mechanisms for monitoring the level of glucose in their
		  habitat and respond quickly to frequent changes in the
		  sugar availability in the environment: the cAMP/PKA
		  pathways (with its two branches comprising Ras and the
		  Gpr1/Gpa2 module), the Rgt2/Snf3-Rgt1 pathway and the main
		  repression pathway involving the kinase Snf1. The cAMP/PKA
		  pathway plays the prominent role in responding to changes
		  in glucose availability and initiating the signaling
		  processes that promote cell growth and division. Snf1 (the
		  yeast homologous to mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase)
		  is primarily required for the adaptation of yeast cell to
		  glucose limitation and for growth on alternative carbon
		  source, but it is also involved in the cellular response to
		  various environmental stresses. The Rgt2/Snf3-Rgt1 pathway
		  regulates the expression of genes required for glucose
		  uptake. Many interconnections exist between the diverse
		  glucose sensing systems, which enables yeast cells to fine
		  tune cell growth, cell cycle and their coordination in
		  response to nutritional changes.},

  abstract	= {GLUT1 is the predominant glucose transporter in leukemia
		  cells, and the modulation of glucose transport activity by
		  cytokines, oncogenes or metabolic stresses is essential for
		  their survival and proliferation. However, the molecular
		  mechanisms allowing to control GLUT1 trafficking and
		  degradation are still under debate. In this study we
		  investigated whether plasma membrane cholesterol depletion
		  plays a role in glucose transport activity in M07e cells, a
		  human megakaryocytic leukemia line. To this purpose, the
		  effect of cholesterol depletion by
		  methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (MBCD) on both GLUT1 activity
		  and trafficking was compared to that of the cytokine Stem
		  Cell Factor (SCF). Results show that, like SCF, MBCD led to
		  an increased glucose transport rate and caused a
		  subcellular redistribution of GLUT1, recruiting
		  intracellular transporter molecules to the plasma membrane.
		  Due to the role of caveolae/lipid rafts in GLUT1
		  stimulation in response to many stimuli, we have also
		  investigated the GLUT1 distribution along the fractions
		  obtained after non ionic detergent treatment and density
		  gradient centrifugation, which was only slightly changed
		  upon MBCD treatment. The data suggest that MBCD exerts its
		  action via a cholesterol-dependent mechanism that
		  ultimately results in augmented GLUT1 translocation.
		  Moreover, cholesterol depletion triggers GLUT1
		  translocation without the involvement of c-kit signalling
		  pathway, in fact MBCD effect does not involve Akt and
		  PLC$\gamma$ phosphorylation. These data, together with the
		  observation that the combined MBCD/SCF cell treatment
		  caused an additive effect on glucose uptake, suggest that
		  the action of SCF and MBCD may proceed through two distinct
		  mechanisms, the former following a signalling pathway, and
		  the latter possibly involving a novel cholesterol dependent
		  mechanism.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Cell motility plays a central role in
		  development, wound-healing and tumour invasion. Cultures of
		  eukaryotic cells are a complex system where most cells move
		  according to 'random' patterns, but may also be induced to
		  a more coordinate migration by means of specific stimuli,
		  such as the presence of chemical attractants or the
		  introduction of a mechanical stimulus. Various tools have
		  been developed that work by keeping track of the paths
		  followed by specific objects and by performing statistical
		  analysis on the recorded path data. The available tools
		  include desktop applications or macros running within a
		  commercial package, which address specific aspects of the
		  process.
		  
		  RESULTS: An online application, MotoCell, was developed to
		  evaluate the motility of cell populations maintained in
		  various experimental conditions. Statistical analysis of
		  cell behaviour consists of the evaluation of descriptive
		  parameters such as average speed and angle, directional
		  persistence, path vector length, calculated for the whole
		  population as well as for each cell and for each step of
		  the migration; in this way the behaviour of a whole cell
		  population may be assessed as a whole or as a sum of
		  individual entities. The directional movement of objects
		  may be studied by eliminating the modulo effect in circular
		  statistics analysis, able to evaluate linear dispersion
		  coefficient (R) and angular dispersion (S) values together
		  with average angles. A case study is provided where the
		  system is used to characterize motility of RasV12
		  transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Here we describe a comprehensive tool which
		  takes care of all steps in cell motility analysis,
		  including interactive cell tracking, path editing and
		  statistical analysis of cell movement, all within a freely
		  available online service. Although based on a standard web
		  interface, the program is very fast and interactive and is
		  immediately available to a large number of users, while
		  exploiting the web approach in a very effective way. The
		  ability to evaluate the behaviour of single cells allows to
		  draw the attention on specific correlations, such as
		  linearity of movement and deviation from the expected
		  direction. In addition to population statistics, the
		  analysis of single cells allows to group the cells into
		  subpopulations, or even to evaluate the behaviour of each
		  cell with respect to a variable reference, such as the
		  direction of a wound or the position of the closest cell.},

		  it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase
		  expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to reversal of

		  N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP), a peptide
		  normally found in tissues and biological fluids, reduces
		  collagen deposition in the heart and kidneys of
		  hypertensive rats and rats with myocardial infarction.
		  However, it is not known whether endogenous Ac-SDKP at

		  responsible for release of Ac-SDKP from its precursor
		  thymosin-beta(4). When we treated rats with a specific oral

		  Ac-SDKP at basal levels plays a physiological role,
		  antagonizing and/or preventing excessive collagen
		  deposition. We studied whether chronic blockade of Ac-SDKP
		  promotes collagen accumulation and/or accelerates this
		  process in the presence of a profibrotic stimulus such as
		  angiotensin II. We found that decreased basal levels of
		  Ac-SDKP increased cardiac and renal perivascular fibrosis
		  and promoted glomerulosclerosis. Moreover, in the presence
		  of angiotensin II decreasing basal levels of Ac-SDKP
		  accelerated interstitial cardiac fibrosis attributable to
		  an increase in cells that produce collagen. We concluded

  abstract	= {PURPOSE Histopathology is the standard approach for tissue
		  diagnostics and centerpiece of pathology. Although the
		  current system provides prognostic information, there is
		  need for molecular markers that enhance diagnosis and
		  better predict clinical prognosis. The ability to localize
		  disease-specific molecular changes in biopsy tissue would
		  help improve critical pathology decision making. Direct
		  profiling of proteins from tissue using matrix-assisted
		  laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry has
		  the potential to supplement morphology with underlying
		  molecular detail. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A discovery set of 11
		  prostate cancer (PCa)-containing and 10 benign prostate
		  tissue sections was evaluated for protein expression
		  differences. A separate validation set of 54 tissue
		  sections (23 PCa and 31 benign) was used to verify the
		  results. Cryosectioning was done to yield tissue sections
		  analyzed by a pathologist to determine tissue morphology
		  and mirror sections for imaging mass spectrometry. Spectra
		  were acquired and the intensity of signals was plotted as a
		  function of the location within the tissue. RESULTS An
		  expression profile was found that discriminates between PCa
		  and normal tissue. The overexpression of a single ion at
		  m/z 4,355 was able to discriminate cancer from uninvolved
		  tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry identified this marker as
		  a fragment of mitogen-activated protein
		  kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase
		  2 (MEKK2). The ability of MEKK2 to discriminate tumor from
		  normal cells was orthogonally confirmed. CONCLUSIONS This
		  study highlights the potential of this approach to uncover
		  molecular detail that can be correlated with pathology
		  decision making. In addition, the identification of MEKK2
		  shows the ability to discover proteins of relevance to PCa
		  biology.},

		  accelerated wound healing, and the metastatic potential of
		  tumor cells. However, little is known about the
		  mechanism(s) by which thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 promotes
		  metastasis. Methods: Northern blot analysis and
		  immunohistochemistry were used to examine thymosin
		  {\{}beta{\}}4 expression in mouse melanoma B16 cell lines
		  and in B16-F10 cells derived from metastatic mouse lung
		  tumors, respectively. B16-F10 cells infected with
		  adenoviruses containing a thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 expression
		  vector or an empty vector were injected subcutaneously and
		  intravenously into C57BL/6 mice to evaluate tumor growth
		  and metastatic potential, respectively. In vitro assays
		  were used to study cell migration, invasion, matrix
		  metalloproteinase activity, cell proliferation, and
		  angiogenic activity of adenovirus-infected B16-F10 cells.
		  Statistical significance of all results was analyzed by
		  two-tailed Student's t tests. Results: Thymosin
		  {\{}beta{\}}4 mRNA was expressed in primary cultured
		  B16-F10 cells derived from lung metastases and in B16-F10
		  cells that had formed lung tumors after being injected into
		  mice but not in the B16-F1, B16-F10, or B16-BL6 cell lines.
		  The mean tumor sizes in mice 20 days after injection with
		  B16-F10 cells infected with thymosin
		  {\{}beta{\}}4-expressing adenovirus and with control
		  adenovirus were 21.7 mm (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] =
		  17.7 to 25.7 mm) and 13.3 mm (95{\%} CI = 11.1 to 15.3 mm),
		  respectively (difference = 8.4 mm; P = .036). The mean
		  numbers of metastatic lung nodules in mice (n = 20) 2 weeks
		  after intravenous injection with thymosin

		  (95{\%} CI = 6.2 to 15.6), respectively (difference = 35.8
		  metastatic lung nodules, P{\textless}.001). Thymosin

		  necessary to choose precise strategies of treatment for
		  patients. One of effective approaches in the prediction is
		  the integration of multi-omics data, which reduces the
		  impact of noise within single omics data. However,
		  integrating multi-omics data brings large number of
		  redundant variables and relative small sample sizes. In
		  this study, we employed Autoencoder networks to extract
		  important features that were then input to the proportional
		  hazards model to predict the cancer prognosis. Results: The
		  method was applied to 12 common cancers from the Cancer
		  Genome Atlas. The results show that the multi-omics
		  averagely improves 4.1{\%} C-index for prognosis prediction
		  over single mRNA data, and our method outperforms previous
		  approaches by at least 7.4{\%}. A comparison of the
		  contribution of single omics data show that mRNA
		  contributes the most, followed by the DNA methylation,
		  miRNA, and the copy number variation. In the case study for
		  differential gene expression analysis, we identified 161
		  differentially expressed genes in the cervical cancer,
		  among which 77 genes (65.8{\%}) have been proven to be

		  (OSCC) are urgently needed. We conducted genome-wide
		  CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 21 OSCC cell lines, primarily
		  derived from Asians, to identify genetic vulnerabilities
		  that can be explored as therapeutic targets. We identify
		  known and novel fitness genes and demonstrate that many
		  previously identified OSCC-related cancer genes are
		  non-essential and could have limited therapeutic value,
		  while other fitness genes warrant further investigation for
		  their potential as therapeutic targets. We validate a
		  distinctive dependency on YAP1 and WWTR1 of the Hippo
		  pathway, where the lost-of-fitness effect of one paralog
		  can be compensated only in a subset of lines. We also
		  discover that OSCCs with WWTR1 dependency signature are
		  significantly associated with biomarkers of favourable
		  response towards immunotherapy. In summary, we have
		  delineated the genetic vulnerabilities of OSCC, enabling
		  the prioritization of therapeutic targets for further

		  HPV infection and wnt-$\beta$-catenin self-renewal pathway
		  in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC). For this reason, the molecular profiles
		  (methylation/deletion/expression) of antagonists (SFRP1/2
		  and DKK1), agonists (FZD7 and LRP6) and effector protein
		  $\beta$-catenin of the pathway were analyzed in HPV
		  positive/negative oral epithelium at first, followed by its

		  expression of FZD7 and significant down regulation of
		  SFRP1/2 through promoter hypermethylation due to over
		  expression of DNMT1 with ubiquitous down regulation of DKK1
		  and up-regulation of LRP6. This phenomenon has been seen in
		  respective HPV positive and negative HNSCC tumors with

		  In this study, we found that high levels of ROS were

		  cells. This elevated ROS production was inhibited by NADPH
		  oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and
		  mitochondria electron chain inhibitor rotenone in the
		  cells. To further analyze the source of ROS production, we
		  found that ovarian cancer cells have much higher expression

		  analyze the functional relevance of ROS production, we
		  showed that ROS regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1

		  However, to date the mechanistic link between Cdk5 and p38
		  remains unclear. This study presents the first mechanism
		  showing Cdk5 as a major regulator of p38 cascade in neurons
		  and in transgenic mouse model of AD. Using beta-amyloid and
		  glutamate as the neurotoxic stimuli, our results show that
		  deregulated Cdk5 induces p38 activation by increasing

		  primary cortical neurons. Elimination of ROS inhibits p38
		  activation, revealing ROS as major stimuli of the p38
		  cascade. Importantly, Cdk5-mediated p38 activation
		  increases c-Jun expression, thereby revealing a mechanistic
		  link between deregulated Cdk5 and c-Jun level in AD brains.
		  c-Jun is over-expressed in AD, and is believed to
		  contribute significantly to neurodegeneration. Based on the

  abstract	= {Background: Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is
		  one of the most common cancers worldwide and has been
		  considered to be highly associated with altered biological
		  processes, including immunocyte chemotaxis, inflammatory
		  response, angiogenesis, and/or immune regulation,
		  suggesting that the levels of the tumor-related cytokines
		  and chemokines will be dysregulated in the tumor
		  microenvironment as well as in the systemic circulation and
		  might be associated with some OSCC phenotypes. Methods: To
		  profile cytokines in OSCC patients, the plasma levels of 48
		  proteins (26 cytokines, 10 chemokines, and 12 growth
		  factors) were measured in 111 untreated OSCC patients, 112
		  healthy individuals, and 107 individuals with oral
		  premalignant lesion (OPL). Result: Compared to the plasma
		  levels in the healthy individuals and OPL group, the levels
		  of 12 proteins were significantly dysregulated in the OSCC
		  patients. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of
		  IFN-$\alpha$2, IL-2RA, and SCF were significantly lower in
		  patients with higher pT status. IFN-$\alpha$2 levels also
		  decreased in patients with higher tumor depths. Moreover,
		  OSCC patients with greater levels of VEGF ({\textgreater}
		  4.87. pg/ml) before treatment had worse prognoses for

		  synthase and the electron transfer chain exist on the
		  plasma membrane in a punctuated distribution of lung
		  adenocarcinoma cells, where it is critical to support
		  cancer cell proliferation. Applying ATP synthase inhibitor
		  citreoviridin induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited
		  proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung
		  cancer cells. Analysis of protein expression profiles after
		  citreoviridin treatment suggested this compound induced the

		  (eIF2$\alpha$), triggering cell growth inhibition.
		  Citreoviridin-enhanced eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation could
		  be reversed by siRNA-mediated attenuation of the UPR kinase
		  PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) combined with
		  treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine,
		  establishing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) boost UPR
		  after citreoviridin treatment. Thus, a coordinate elevation
		  of UPR and ROS initiates a positive feedback loop that

		  a molecular function for ectopic ATP synthase at the plasma

  abstract	= {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key
		  mechanism in both embryonic development and cancer
		  metastasis. The EMT introduces stem-like properties to
		  cancer cells. However, during somatic cell reprogramming,
		  mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), the reverse
		  process of EMT, is a crucial step toward pluripotency.
		  Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a multifunctional
		  secreted protein that acts as either an oncoprotein or a
		  tumor suppressor among different cancers. Here, we show
		  that in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CTGF
		  promotes the MET and reduces invasiveness. Moreover, we
		  found that CTGF enhances the stem-like properties of HNSCC
		  cells and increases the expression of multiple pluripotency
		  genes. Mechanistic studies showed that CTGF induces c-Jun
		  expression through $\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrin and that
		  c-Jun directly activates the transcription of the
		  pluripotency genes NANOG, SOX2, and POU5F1. Knockdown of
		  CTGF in TW2.6 cells was shown to reduce tumor formation and
		  attenuate E-cadherin expression in xenotransplanted tumors.
		  In HNSCC patient samples, CTGF expression was positively
		  correlated with the levels of CDH1, NANOG, SOX2, and
		  POU5F1. Coexpression of CTGF and the pluripotency genes was
		  found to be associated with a worse prognosis. These
		  findings are valuable in elucidating the interplay between

		  the major alkaloid in areca quid and is thought to be
		  involved in the pathogenesis of OSF. Our previous studies
		  have demonstrated that arecoline could induce
		  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors in
		  primary human buccal mucosal fibroblasts (BMFs). Therefore,
		  we investigated the expression of zinc finger E-box binding
		  homeobox 1 (ZEB1), which is a well-known transcriptional
		  factor in EMT, in OSF tissues and its role in
		  arecoline-induced myofibroblast transdifferentiation from
		  BMFs. The expression of ZEB1, as well as the myofibroblast
		  marker $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA), was
		  significantly increased in OSF tissues, respectively. With
		  immunofluorescence analysis, arecoline induced the
		  formation of $\alpha$-SMA-positive stress fibres in BMFs
		  expressing nuclear ZEB1. Arecoline also induced collagen
		  contraction of BMFs in vitro. By chromatin
		  immunoprecipitation, the binding of ZEB1 to the
		  $\alpha$-SMA promoter in BMFs was increased by arecoline.
		  The promoter activity of $\alpha$-SMA in BMFs was also
		  induced by arecoline, while knockdown of ZEB1 abolished
		  arecoline-induced $\alpha$-SMA promoter activity and
		  collagen contraction of BMFs. Long-term exposure of BMFs to
		  arecoline induced the expression of fibrogenic genes and
		  ZEB1. Silencing of ZEB1 in fibrotic BMFs from an OSF
		  patient also suppressed the expression of $\alpha$-SMA and
		  myofibroblast activity. Inhibition of insulin-like growth
		  factor receptor-1 could suppress arecoline-induced ZEB1
		  activation in BMFs. Our data suggest that ZEB1 may
		  participate in the pathogenesis of areca quid-associated

		  performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in
		  HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The
		  detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in
		  inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our
		  clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4
		  expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was
		  significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS,
		  P = 0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001).
		  Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell
		  lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a
		  significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and
		  in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in
		  GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression
		  model, we performed gene expression microarray and
		  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the
		  transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24
		  (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In
		  addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target
		  of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the
		  migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in
		  HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered
		  glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed
		  that it could be partially attributed to the novel link
		  between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be
		  used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC
		  in the future.},

  abstract	= {The occurrence of more than 200 diseases, including
		  cancer, can be attributed to alcohol drinking. The global
		  cancer deaths attributed to alcohol-consumption rose from
		  243,000 in 1990 to 337,400 in 2010. In 2010, cancer deaths
		  due to alcohol consumption accounted for 4.2{\%} of all
		  cancer deaths. Strong epidemiological evidence has
		  established the causal role of alcohol in the development
		  of various cancers, including esophageal cancer, head and
		  neck cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal
		  cancer. The evidence for the association between alcohol
		  and other cancers is inconclusive. Because of the high
		  prevalence of ALDH2*2 allele among East Asian populations,
		  East Asians may be more susceptible to the carcinogenic
		  effect of alcohol, with most evidence coming from studies
		  of esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer, while data
		  for other cancers are more limited. The high prevalence of
		  ALDH2*2 allele in East Asian populations may have important
		  public health implications and may be utilized to reduce
		  the occurrence of alcohol-related cancers among East
		  Asians, including: 1) Identification of individuals at high
		  risk of developing alcohol-related cancers by screening for
		  ALDH2 polymorphism; 2) Incorporation of ALDH2 polymorphism
		  screening into behavioral intervention program for
		  promoting alcohol abstinence or reducing alcohol
		  consumption; 3) Using ALDH2 polymorphism as a prognostic
		  indicator for alcohol-related cancers; 4) Targeting ALDH2
		  for chemoprevention; and 5) Setting guidelines for alcohol
		  consumption among ALDH2 deficient individuals. Future

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is the first-line chemotherapy used
		  against most upper aerodigestive tract carcinomas. In head
		  and neck cancer, sensitivity to cisplatin remains the key
		  issue in treatment response and outcome. Genetic
		  heterogeneity and aberrant gene expression may be the
		  intrinsic factors that cause primary cisplatin-resistance.
		  METHODS: Combination of the HNSCC gene expression data and
		  the cisplatin sensitivity results from public database. We
		  found that aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1)
		  may be associated with cisplatin sensitivity in HNSCC
		  treatment of na{\"{i}}ve cells. We examined the AKR1C1
		  expression and its correlation with cisplatin IC(50) and
		  prognosis in patients. The in vitro and in vivo AKR1C1
		  functions in cisplatin-resistance through overexpression or
		  knockdown assays, respectively. cDNA microarrays were used
		  to identify the upstream regulators that modulate
		  AKR1C1-induced signaling in HNSCC. Finally, we used the
		  cigarette metabolites to promote AKR1C1 expression and
		  ruxolitinib to overcome AKR1C1-induced
		  cisplatin-resistance. RESULTS: AKR1C1 positively correlates
		  to cisplatin-resistance in HNSCC cells. AKR1C1 is a poor
		  prognostic factor for recurrence and death of HNSCC
		  patients. Silencing of AKR1C1 not only reduced in vitro
		  IC(50) but also increased in vivo cisplatin responses and
		  vise versa in overexpression cells. Cigarette metabolites
		  also promote AKR1C1 expression. Transcriptome analyses
		  revealed that STAT1 and STAT3 activation enable
		  AKR1C1-induced cisplatin-resistance and can be overcome by
		  ruxolitinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: AKR1C1 is a crucial
		  regulator for cisplatin-resistance in HNSCC and also poor
		  prognostic marker for patients. Targeting the AKR1C1-STAT
		  axis may provide a new therapeutic strategy to treat
		  patients who are refractory to cisplatin treatment.},

		  In addition, STIP1 secreted by human ovarian cancer cells
		  has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation by
		  binding to ALK2 (activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2)
		  and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways. In this
		  study, a total of 330 ovarian cancer tumor samples were
		  evaluated for STIP1 expression by immunohistochemistry and
		  analyzed for a possible correlation with patient
		  characteristics and survival. The quantification of
		  immunoreactivity was accomplished by applying an
		  immunohistochemical scoring system (histoscore). Patients
		  with high-level STIP1 expression (histoscore ≥169) had a
		  significantly worse survival (high STIP1, mean survival

		  stimulated cell proliferation and migration, but

  abstract	= {Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare but very
		  aggressive form of breast cancer. Its definition is based
		  on clinical criteria, but a molecular definition could be
		  useful when data are incomplete or features are missing.
		  Recently, the identification of overexpression of
		  E-cadherin in IBC has improved understanding of the
		  molecular basis of this disease. Consequently, the aim of
		  this study was to try to determine an immunophenotypic
		  'signature' of IBC. A series of 80 cases of IBC were
		  compared with 552 non-IBC control cases and a model was
		  elaborated to evaluate the probability of an inflammatory
		  carcinoma being present in any clinical situation. Tissue
		  microarrays (TMAs) were used to determine the
		  immunohistochemical profile of eight proteins including
		  E-cadherin, EGFR, oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER
		  and PR), MIB1, ERBB2, MUC1, and P53. All the parameters
		  tested were differentially expressed between IBC and
		  control cases in univariate analysis (p {\textless} 0.001).
		  The five variables that were significantly associated with
		  IBC in multivariate analysis were E-cadherin {\textgreater}
		  or = 300 [HR = 5.64 (2.92-10.87)], ER negative [HR = 3.00
		  (1.67-5.51)], MIB1 {\textgreater} 20 [HR = 3.54
		  (1.87-6.71)], MUC1 cytoplasmic staining [HR = 2.72
		  (1.49-4.96)], and ERBB2 positive 2+ or 3+ [HR = 2.46
		  (1.26-4.78)]. The probability that a breast cancer with
		  this full phenotype at diagnosis was an IBC was 90.5{\%}.
		  If any one of the five parameters was missing, this
		  probability dropped to 75{\%} and was less than 50{\%} when
		  one, two, or three parameters were present. The 5-year
		  overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival
		  (DFS) of patients with IBC were not significantly different
		  from those of the non-IBC control group that expressed four
		  or five parameters (nIBC-1), but this nIBC-1 control group
		  had a significantly worse outcome than the non-IBC control
		  group (nIBC-2) with only 0-3 parameters (p = 0.0049 for OS
		  and p {\textless} 0.0001 for DFS). In conclusion, an
		  immunophenotypic signature was suggested for IBC. This
		  could help to determine the worst cases, independent of
		  clinical criteria.},

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Estimating the future course of patients with
		  cancer lesions is invaluable to physicians; however,
		  current clinical methods fail to effectively use the vast
		  amount of multimodal data that is available for cancer
		  patients. To tackle this problem, we constructed a
		  multimodal neural network-based model to predict the
		  survival of patients for 20 different cancer types using
		  clinical data, mRNA expression data, microRNA expression
		  data and histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). We
		  developed an unsupervised encoder to compress these four
		  data modalities into a single feature vector for each
		  patient, handling missing data through a resilient,
		  multimodal dropout method. Encoding methods were tailored
		  to each data type-using deep highway networks to extract
		  features from clinical and genomic data, and convolutional
		  neural networks to extract features from WSIs. RESULTS: We
		  used pancancer data to train these feature encodings and
		  predict single cancer and pancancer overall survival,
		  achieving a C-index of 0.78 overall. This work shows that
		  it is possible to build a pancancer model for prognosis
		  that also predicts prognosis in single cancer sites.
		  Furthermore, our model handles multiple data modalities,
		  efficiently analyzes WSIs and represents patient multimodal
		  data flexibly into an unsupervised, informative
		  representation. We thus present a powerful automated tool
		  to accurately determine prognosis, a key step towards
		  personalized treatment for cancer patients. AVAILABILITY

  abstract	= {Background: The transgenerational metabolic effects of
		  betel-quid chewing have been reported in mice but not in
		  humans. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether
		  exposure to paternal chewing of betel nut quids led to an
		  increased risk of early manifestation of the metabolic
		  syndrome (MetS) in human offspring. Design: The subjects
		  were selected from 66 971 residents aged {\textgreater} 19
		  y who attended a community-based Integrated Screening
		  Program in Taiwan and who were identified as parent-child
		  trios (n = 5037). Using a population-based, parent-child
		  study design, we compared the mean ages of offspring with
		  MetS at entry between those who were exposed and those who
		  were unexposed to paternal chewing of quids containing
		  betel nut. Cox proportional hazards regression models were
		  used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and to assess
		  dose-response relations for paternal betel-quid exposure.
		  Results: The offspring who were exposed to paternal
		  betel-quid chewing were younger than those who were not
		  exposed, regardless of MetS status; they also had a
		  2.14-fold increase in the risk of early manifestation of
		  MetS (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.14; 95{\%} CI: 1.25, 3.66)
		  after control for environmental and other risk factors,
		  including personal betel chewing. Significant dose-response
		  relations were found between the risk of early MetS and the
		  quantity and duration of paternal exposure to betel quids.
		  In the absence of MetS in either parent and of betel-quid
		  consumption by the offspring, paternal exposure to betel
		  quids increased the risk of early manifestation of MetS in
		  offspring 2.53-fold (95{\%} CI: 1.03, 2.64) compared with
		  paternal nonexposure. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that
		  exposure to paternal betel-quid chewing increases the risk
		  of early manifestation of MetS in human offspring in a
		  dose-dependent manner.},

		  substantial mortality and morbidity. To identify potential
		  biomarkers for the early detection of invasive OSCC, we
		  compared the gene expressions of incident primary OSCC,
		  oral dysplasia, and clinically normal oral tissue from
		  surgical patients without head and neck cancer or
		  preneoplastic oral lesions (controls), using Affymetrix
		  U133 2.0 Plus arrays. We identified 131 differentially
		  expressed probe sets using a training set of 119 OSCC
		  patients and 35 controls. Forward and stepwise logistic
		  regression analyses identified 10 successive combinations
		  of genes which expression differentiated OSCC from
		  controls. The best model included LAMC2, encoding
		  laminin-$\gamma$2 chain, and COL4A1, encoding collagen,
		  type IV $\alpha$1 chain. Subsequent modeling without these
		  two markers showed that COL1A1, encoding collagen, type I
		  $\alpha$1 chain, and PADI1, encoding peptidyl arginine
		  deiminase, type 1, could also distinguish OSCC from
		  controls. We validated these two models using an internal
		  independent testing set of 48 invasive OSCC and 10 controls
		  and an external testing set of 42 head and neck squamous

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been
		  widely used to characterize cellular states in response to
		  various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc.
		  Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has
		  been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of
		  expression profiling over thousands of samples is still
		  very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often
		  highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program
		  have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only
		  ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on
		  computational methods to infer the expression of remaining
		  target genes. However, the computational approach adopted
		  by the LINCS program is currently based on linear
		  regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not
		  capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions
		  of genes. RESULTS: We present a deep learning method
		  (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target
		  genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the
		  microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset,
		  consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model
		  and compare its performance to those from other methods. In
		  terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes,
		  deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33{\%}
		  relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis
		  shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in
		  99.97{\%} of the target genes. We also tested the
		  performance of our learned model on an independent
		  RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921
		  expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR
		  with 6.57{\%} relative improvement, and achieves lower
		  error in 81.31{\%} of the target genes. AVAILABILITY AND

		  Simultaneously, high expression level of IL-6R mRNA

		  of the urinary system that seriously threatens the health
		  of a population. In recent years, the application of
		  immunotherapy has significantly changed the treatment of
		  bladder cancer, but only some patients can benefit from the
		  treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Many problems
		  are unsolved in the field of bladder cancer immunotherapy,
		  especially in the search for genes that are critical to the
		  level of immune cell infiltration and new effective
		  therapeutic targets. We attempted to use bioinformatics
		  analysis to identify immune gene markers related to the
		  prognosis of bladder cancer and to establish a prognostic
		  signature for bladder cancer patients based on their immune
		  gene expression profiles. We used univariate Cox
		  proportional hazards regression analysis, the least
		  absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox
		  regression, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
		  regression analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas bladder
		  cancer cohort (TCGA-BLCA). Fifteen genes related to
		  prognosis were screened using the survival analysis,
		  correlation analysis, cancer and adjacent cancer
		  differential expression analysis, and mutation analysis.
		  The potential biological role of these genes was determined
		  using survival analysis and principal component analysis
		  (PCA). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
		  assesses the prognostic value of the predictive signature.
		  The gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and
		  Genome (KEGG), Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and
		  other methods were used to reveal the differential gene
		  enrichment in the signaling pathways and cellular processes
		  of high- and low-risk groups. The single-sample GSEA
		  (ssGSEA) method was used to quantify the infiltration
		  levels of 24 immune cells in the tumor immune
		  microenvironment and these immune genes were found to be
		  closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment. In
		  summary, we screened 15 immune genes that were closely
		  related to bladder cancer overall survival (OS) and may be
		  potential prognostic indicators of bladder cancer. They may
		  have research and clinical application value in bladder
		  cancer immunotherapy. We used 15 immune genes to construct

		  However, most deep learning-based objective outcome
		  prediction and grading paradigms are based on histology or

		  information in an intuitive manner. In this work, we
		  propose Pathomic Fusion, an interpretable strategy for

		  (mutations, CNV, RNASeq) features for survival outcome
		  prediction. Our approach models pairwise feature
		  interactions across modalities by taking the Kronecker
		  product of unimodal feature representations, and controls
		  the expressiveness of each representation via a gatingbased
		  attention mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are
		  able to interpret and saliently localize features across
		  each modality, and understand how feature importance shifts
		  when conditioning on multimodal input. We validate our
		  approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma
		  datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which

		  transcriptome data with ground truth survival and

  abstract	= {Background:Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading
		  causes of cancer-related death. In the present research, we
		  adopted a comprehensive bioinformatics method to identify
		  some biomarkers associated with the tumor progression and
		  prognosis of PCa.Methods:Differentially expressed genes
		  (DEGs) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network
		  analysis (WGCNA) were applied for exploring gene modules
		  correlative with tumor progression and prognosis of PCa.
		  Clinically Significant Modules were distinguished, and Gene
		  Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
		  (KEGG) analysis were used to Annotation, Visualization and
		  Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Protein-protein interaction
		  (PPI) networks were used in selecting potential hub genes.
		  RNA-Seq data and clinical materials of prostate cancer from
		  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used for the
		  identification and validation of hub genes. The
		  significance of these genes was confirmed via survival
		  analysis and immunohistochemistry.Results:2688 DEGs were
		  filtered. Weighted gene co-expression network was
		  constructed, and DEGs were divided into 6 modules. Two
		  modules were selected as hub modules which were highly
		  associated with the tumor grades. Functional enrichment
		  analysis was performed on genes in hub modules. Thirteen
		  hub genes in these hub modules were identified through PPT
		  networks. Based on TCGA data, 4 of them (CCNB1, TTK, CNN1,
		  and ACTG2) were correlated with prognosis. The protein
		  levels of CCNB1, TTK, and ACTG2 had a degree of differences
		  between tumor tissues and normal tissues.Conclusion:Four
		  hub genes were identified as candidate biomarkers and
		  potential therapeutic targets for further studies of
		  exploring molecular mechanisms and individual therapy on
		  PCa.},

  abstract	= {Female breast cancer (BCa) is the most commonly occurring
		  cancer worldwide. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an
		  essential role in tumor invasion, angiogenesis, unlimited
		  proliferation, and even immune escape, but we know little
		  about the TME of BCa. In this study, we aimed to find a
		  TME-related biomarker for BCa, especially for invasive
		  breast carcinoma (BRCA), that could predict prognosis and
		  immunotherapy efficacy. Based on RNA-seq transcriptome data
		  and the clinical characteristics of 1222 samples (113
		  normal and 1109 tumor samples) from The Cancer Genome Atlas
		  (TCGA) database, we used the ESTIMATE algorithm to
		  calculate the ImmuneScore and StromalScore and then
		  identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
		  the high and low ImmuneScore groups and the high and low
		  StromalScore groups. Thereafter, a protein–protein
		  interaction (PPI) network analysis and univariate Cox
		  regression analyses of overall survival were used to
		  identify potential key genes. Five candidate genes were
		  identified, comprising CD2, CCL19, CD52, CD3E, and ITK.
		  Thereafter, we focused on CD2, analyzing CD2 expression and
		  its association with survival. CD2 expression was
		  associated with tumor size (T stage) to some extent, but
		  not with overall TNM stage, lymph node status (N stage), or
		  distant metastasis (M stage). High CD2 expression was
		  associated with longer survival. METABRIC data were used to
		  validate the survival result (n = 276). Gene set enrichment
		  analysis (GSEA) showed that the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
		  and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were significantly
		  associated with high CD2 expression were mainly
		  immune-related pathways. Furthermore, CD2 expression was
		  correlated with 16 types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells
		  (TICs). Hence, CD2 might be a novel biomarker in terms of
		  molecular typing, and it may serve as a complementary
		  approach to TNM staging to improve clinical outcome
		  prediction for BCa patients.},

		  surface protein expression, alters signal transduction, and
		  interacts with the cytoskeleton and proteins involved in
		  actin polymerization. These functions are required for
		  glucose uptake by insulin-stimulated adipocytes. We sought
		  to determine whether Nef alters adipocyte glucose
		  homeostasis. Using radiolabeled glucose, we found that
		  adipocytes exposed to recombinant Nef took in 42{\%} less
		  glucose after insulin stimulation than did control cells.
		  This reduction resulted from a Nef-dependent inhibition of
		  glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) trafficking, as assessed by
		  means of immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot analysis
		  revealed a decrease in phosphorylation of signal
		  transducing proteins after Nef treatment, and fluorescence
		  microscopy showed a dramatic alteration in cortical actin
		  organization. We conclude that Nef interferes with
		  insulin-stimulated processes in adipocytes. We have
		  identified HIV Nef, which is detectable and antigenic in
		  serum samples from HIV-infected people, as a novel

		  induced the accumulation of glycogen in epithelial cancer

		  yield and lymph node density from selective or elective
		  neck dissections are predictive of patient outcomes and may
		  be used for patient counseling, treatment planning, or
		  quality measurement. Our objective was to systematically
		  review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis of
		  studies that investigated the prognostic significance of
		  lymph node yield and/or lymph node density after neck
		  dissection for patients with head and neck cancer. Data
		  Sources: The Ovid/Medline, Ovid/Embase, and NLM PubMed
		  databases were systematically searched on January 23, 2017,
		  for articles published between January 1, 1946, and January
		  23, 2017. Review Methods: We reviewed English-language
		  original research that included survival analysis of
		  patients undergoing neck dissection for a head and neck
		  malignancy stratified by lymph node yield and/or lymph node
		  density. Study data were extracted by 2 independent
		  researchers (S.C. and M.O.). We utilized the DerSimonian
		  and Laird random effects model to account for heterogeneity
		  of studies. Results: Our search yielded 350 nonduplicate
		  articles, with 23 studies included in the final synthesis.
		  Pooled results demonstrated that increased lymph node yield
		  was associated with a significant improvement in survival
		  (hazard ratio, 0.833; 95{\%} CI, 0.790-0.879).
		  Additionally, we found that increased lymph node density
		  was associated with poorer survival (hazard ratio, 1.916;
		  95{\%} CI, 1.637-2.241). Conclusions: Increased nodal yield
		  portends improved outcomes and may be a valuable quality
		  indicator for neck dissections, while increased lymph node
		  density is associated with diminished survival and may be
		  used for postsurgical counseling and planning for adjuvant
		  therapy.},

		  urothelial cancer (UCa). Different DC subsets expressed
		  BTLA and TIM-3 but not other IRs. More importantly, BTLA
		  and TIM-3 were significantly upregulated in DCs from blood
		  of UCa patients. Locally, bladder tumor–infiltrating DCs
		  also overexpressed BTLA and TIM-3 compared to DCs from
		  paired nontumoral tissue. Finally, in vitro functional
		  experiments showed that ligand-mediated engagement of BTLA
		  and TIM-3 receptors significantly reduced the secretion of
		  effector cytokines by DC subpopulations. Our findings
		  demonstrate that UCa induces local and systemic
		  overexpression of BTLA and TIM-3 by DCs that may result in
		  their functional inhibition, highlighting these receptors
		  as potential targets for UCa treatment. Patient summary We
		  investigated the expression and function of a panel of
		  inhibitory receptors in dendritic cells (DCs), an immune
		  cell subpopulation critical in initiation of protective
		  immune responses, among patients with urothelial carcinoma.
		  We found high expression of BTLA and TIM-3 by blood and
		  tumor DCs, which could potentially mediate decreased DC
		  function. The results suggest that BTLA and TIM-3 might be
		  new targets for urothelial carcinoma treatment.},

  abstract	= {The regulation of immune responses occurring during
		  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy need to be better
		  scrutinized in order to identify new targetable pathways
		  for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer treatment.
		  Immunoregulatory mechanisms have emerged as key players in
		  various cancers. While T lymphocytes are crucial for the
		  control of tumor growth, they often include regulatory
		  subsets known to restrain their anti-tumor activity. In
		  this prospective study, we assessed conventional regulatory
		  T cells (cTregs) and PD-L1-expressing CD4 T cells (PD-L1(+)
		  Tregs) levels in blood and urine of urothelial cancer (UCa)
		  patients undergoing BCG treatment. Local cTregs were found
		  at higher frequencies than their counterpart in the
		  periphery and induced by bladder tumor cells in vitro.
		  Interestingly, while circulating PD-L1(+) Tregs were hardly
		  detectable in the blood of healthy donors and UCa patients,
		  substantial levels were found in patients' urine. In vitro
		  experiments suggested that BCG infection of urothelial
		  cells could induce PD-L1(+) Tregs, partially via an
		  interferon-$\beta$-mediated mechanism. Of note, high level
		  of Tregs in urine was associated with rapid recurrence
		  following BCG therapy. Our findings demonstrate that T
		  lymphocytes recruited during BCG therapy encompass a
		  significant fraction of regulatory cells including a
		  non-classical source of PD-L1 and reinforce treatment
		  strategies combining BCG with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint
		  inhibitors as promising approaches for non-muscle invasive
		  bladder cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated the
		  presence of particular immune cell types in the urine of
		  bladder cancer patients undergoing Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
		  (BCG) therapy. We identified a cell type that is strongly
		  enriched in the urine after BCG instillation and that may
		  favor tumor recurrence. This immune subpopulation might be
		  targeted for bladder cancer treatment.},

		  continuous gene expression for survival analysis, it is
		  necessary to determine a cutoff point by the
		  dichotomization of the patients. There is some optimization
		  software for cutoff determination. However, those
		  predetermined cutoffs by software usually set at the
		  median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile of RNA sequencing
		  (RNA-Seq) value to find a significant P-value of the
		  Kaplan-Meier curve. There are few clinicopathological
		  features available on their pre-processed data sets.
		  Methods: We developed a comprehensive workflow by R script,
		  running on the Rstudio platform. It includes data
		  retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff
		  mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox
		  proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker discovery.
		  Results: Using this workflow on the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we
		  scanned human protein-coding genes (20,500)
		  programmatically. After adjustment with other confounders,
		  we found that the clinical tumor stage and the surgical
		  margin involvement are independent risk factors in patient
		  survival. According to the resulting tables with Bonferroni
		  adjusted P-value under optimal cutoff as well as hazard
		  ratio ({\&}gt;=1.5), there were ten candidate biomarkers,

  abstract	= {Objective: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known for its
		  high incidence of neck lymph node metastasis, which
		  represents poor prognosis. Nobiletin is a citrus
		  polymethoxyflavonoid that suppresses tumor growth and
		  metastasis, both of which depend on angiogenesis in
		  previous studies. However, the effect of Nobiletin on human
		  NPC cells metastasis has not been clearly clarified.
		  Research design and methods: In this study, we determine
		  the effects of Nobiletin on the migration and invasion in
		  NPC cells. Results: Nobiletin significantly inhibited
		  migration/invasion capacities of HONE-1 and NPC-BM cell
		  lines. The results of gelatin zymography and western
		  blotting revealed that the activities and protein levels of
		  the MMP-2 were inhibited by Nobiletin. Nobiletin also
		  showed that inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Tests of

		  inhibitory effects of Nobiletin on MMP-2 expression in
		  human NPC cells. Nobiletin inhibits MMP-2 expression,
		  up-regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and
		  down-regulation of the transcription factors of

		  seasons 2012 through 2017. Diving fishermen were instructed
		  to attach dive recorders to their waists every fishing day

		  (ReefNet Inc.), with an accuracy of +/-1 foot of seawater
		  (fsw), 0.304 meters, and an activation depth of 10 fsw,

		  and curtail into single-line outputs: pressure, time, date,
		  start of dive and end of dive. An exponential decay formula

		  architectures with many interconnections of simple
		  neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied
		  to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and
		  diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called
		  Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput
		  transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets,
		  Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy
		  compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional
		  hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave
		  penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet
		  also reveals richer biological information, at both the
		  pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer
		  node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive
		  dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new
		  method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on
		  high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

  abstract	= {Deep learning, which describes a class of machine learning
		  algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a
		  variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but
		  the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of
		  this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep
		  learning techniques. We examine applications of deep
		  learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient

		  prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a
		  previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that
		  deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation.
		  More work is needed to address concerns related to
		  interpretability and how to best model each problem.
		  Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), like many
		  solid tumors, contains a heterogeneous population of cancer
		  cells. Recent data suggest that a rare subpopulation of
		  cancer cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSC), is capable of
		  initiating, maintaining, and expanding the growth of tumor.
		  Identification and characterization of CSC from OSCC
		  facilitates the monitoring, therapy, or prevention of OSCC.
		  
		  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enriched oral cancer stem-like
		  cells (OC-SLC) through sphere formation by cultivating OSCC
		  cells from established OSCC cell lines or primary cultures
		  of OSCC patients within defined serum-free medium.
		  Differential expression profile of stemness genes between
		  enriched OC-SLC and parental OSCC was elucidated.
		  Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of stemness
		  markers on OSCC patient tissues was examined to evaluate
		  the association between stemness genes and prognosis of
		  OSCC.
		  
		  RESULTS: Enriched OC-SLC highly expressed the
		  stem/progenitor cell markers and ABC transporter gene
		  (Oct-4, Nanog, CD117, Nestin, CD133, and ABCG2) and also
		  displayed induced differentiation abilities and enhanced
		  migration/invasion/malignancy capabilities in vitro and in
		  vivo. Elevated expression of CD133 was shown in the
		  enriched OC-SLC from OSCC patients' tumors. Positive
		  correlations of Oct-4, Nanog, or CD133 expression on tumor
		  stage were shown on 52 OSCC patient tissues. Kaplan-Meier
		  analyses exhibited that Nanog/Oct-4/CD133 triple-positive
		  patients predicted the worst survival prognosis of OSCC
		  patients.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: We enriched a subpopulation of cancer stem-like
		  cell from OSCC by sphere formation. The enriched OC-SLC
		  possesses the characteristics of both stem cells and
		  malignant tumors. Additionally, expression of stemness
		  markers (Nanog/Oct-4/CD133) contradicts the survival
		  prognosis of OSCC patients.},

		  Chow does not specify the importance of human

		  HPV issue....
		  
		  Author reply: The author replies: HPV vaccination prevents
		  90 to 100{\%} of chronic HPV infections with high-risk
		  serotypes such as 16 and 18, which have been implicated in
		  70{\%} of cervical cancers, 90{\%} of anal cancers, and the
		  majority of oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile
		  cancers.1 The effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination
		  was validated with the use of clinical trial end points of
		  preventing anogenital precursor lesions, such as cervical
		  intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ, and
		  vaginal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, with
		  subsequent real-world decreases in the incidence of
		  precancerous findings and associated cancers.2 Zhuang and
		  Xu emphasize data supporting the hypothesis that HPV
		  vaccination prevents oral HPV-16 infection and will lead to
		  decreases in the incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal
		  cancer. Although I agree with this premise and advocate for
		  vaccination, prospective validated data regarding vaccine
		  efficacy in the prevention of HPV-associated oropharyngeal
		  cancer are currently lacking. It would be helpful for
		  prophylactic vaccine efficacy trials to adopt decreased
		  incidence of oral HPV-16 infection as a compelling
		  surrogate end point because assessment of precancerous
		  conditions is challenging. Moreover, effects of vaccination
		  will not be reflected in oropharyngeal cancer rates for
		  decades because of a latency of 10 to 30 years from
		  infection to the development of cancer.3 Ch'ng points out
		  the changes in pathologic carcinoma in situ (Tis), T0, and
		  T1 tumor-designation differences for HPV-associated and
		  HPV-negative oropharyngeal carcinomas and the need for
		  clarification of inaccuracies in Tables 1 and 2 of my
		  article. For HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, Tis no
		  longer exists because the histologic distinction between in
		  situ disease and invasion is difficult to assess;
		  therefore, readers should replace Tis tumor staging with T0
		  or T1. For HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, Tis exists
		  and can be assessed, whereas T0 should be removed.4 For
		  further staging details, see the 2017 AJCC–UICC 8th
		  edition guidelines.4 Dauby highlights head and neck cancer
		  as an HIV indicator condition, given the greater risk of
		  head and neck cancer among HIV-infected patients than among
		  noninfected persons. The HIV Indicator Diseases across
		  Europe Study (HIDES) I, which was conducted from 2009 to
		  2011, supported the cost-effectiveness of routine HIV
		  testing in reducing morbidity and mortality among patients
		  with an HIV indicator condition when the prevalence
		  exceeded 0.1{\%}.5 Despite expansion of the study to
		  include more centers and indicator conditions in HIDES II,
		  which was conducted from 2012 to 2015, head and neck cancer
		  was not included as an indicator condition, and the
		  decreasing incidence of cancer indicator conditions
		  alongside decreases in the incidence of HIV infection led
		  to decreases in prevalence below HIV testing thresholds for
		  a few indicator cancers.5 Early diagnosis of HIV infection
		  decreases morbidity among patients with high-risk indicator
		  conditions; however, continued decreases in the prevalence
		  of HIV infection in North America and Europe merit
		  reevaluation of routine testing. Laura Q.M. Chow, M.D.

		  significantly higher than in the other study groups

		  significantly associated with tumor stage (P=0.005), tumor

		  May/2017. Eligibility criteria included publications having
		  enough clinical/radiological/histological information to
		  confirm the diagnosis. Results: Fifty-eight publications
		  (169 GOCs) were included. The lesion was slightly more
		  prevalent in men than in women. There was a high prevalence
		  in the fifty/sixth decades of life, in the anterior
		  regions, and in mandibles. Lesions were commonly associated
		  with bone expansion (73{\%}) and unilocular radiological

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
		  presence of high levels of glucose leads to an array of
		  down-regulatory effects known as glucose repression. This
		  process is complex due to the presence of feedback loops
		  and crosstalk between different pathways, complicating the
		  use of intuitive approaches to analyze the system.
		  
		  RESULTS: We established a logical model of yeast glucose
		  repression, formalized as a hypergraph. The model was
		  constructed based on verified regulatory interactions and
		  it includes 50 gene transcripts, 22 proteins, 5 metabolites
		  and 118 hyperedges. We computed the logical steady states
		  of all nodes in the network in order to simulate wildtype
		  and deletion mutant responses to different sugar
		  availabilities. Evaluation of the model predictive power
		  was achieved by comparing changes in the logical state of
		  gene nodes with transcriptome data. Overall, we observed
		  71{\%} true predictions, and analyzed sources of errors and
		  discrepancies for the remaining.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Though the binary nature of logical (Boolean)
		  models entails inherent limitations, our model constitutes
		  a primary tool for storing regulatory knowledge, searching
		  for incoherencies in hypotheses and evaluating the effect
		  of deleting regulatory elements involved in glucose
		  repression.},

		  are the most prominent molecular characteristics of the

		  predictive of disease recurrence was determined by training
		  on the formalin-fixed tumor data set and tested on data
		  from the independent frozen tumor set from 60 HNSCC
		  patients. The difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS)

		  The most significant sets of genes enriched in the

  abstract	= {The early stages of angiogenesis are usually accompanied
		  by the occurrence of vascular leakage, and the deposition
		  of fibrin in extravascular spaces. Initially, the fibrin
		  network acts as a sealing matrix, but later on also as a
		  scaffolding for invading endothelial cells. This process is
		  induced by angiogenic growth factors, particularly by
		  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Angiogenesis
		  involves proteolytic activities, in particular cell-bound
		  urokinase/plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs)
		  activities that modulate the fibrin structure and affect
		  adhesion and migration of endothelial cells. Recent data
		  show that formation of new vessels may be stimulated by
		  thymosin beta-4 (Tbeta-4), but it is still not clear
		  whether Tbeta-4 alone is angiogenic or the angiogenic
		  potential of Tbeta-4 is mediated by VEGF. In this report to
		  further characterize Tbeta-4 angiogenic activity, we
		  produced its mutants that were deprived of the N-terminal
		  tetrapeptide AcSDKP (Tbeta-4((AcSDKPT/4A))), the
		  actin-binding sequence KLKKTET (Tbeta-4((KLKKTET/7A))) and
		  with the nuclear localization sequence damaged by a point
		  mutation Lys16Ala (Tbeta-4((K16A))). Then we tested their
		  activity to induce expression and release of MMPs as well
		  as plasminogen activators inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). We also
		  analyzed their effect on migration and proliferation of
		  endothelial cells in three-dimensional (3D) fibrin matrix
		  as well as on their ability to stimulate the outgrowth of
		  human endothelial cells in capillary-like tubular
		  structures. Our data demonstrate that increased
		  intracellular expression of Tbeta-4 and its mutants is
		  necessary and sufficient to induce PAI-1 gene expression in
		  endothelial cells. Similarly, they stimulate expression and
		  release of MMP-1, -2, and -3. As evaluated by using
		  specific inhibitors to these MMPs, they modified
		  specifically the structure of fibrin and thus facilitated
		  migration of endothelial cells. To sum up, our data show
		  that the mechanism by which Tbeta-4 induced transition of
		  endothelial cells from quiescent to proangiogenic phenotype
		  is characterized by increased expression of PAI-1 and MMPs
		  did not require the presence of the N-terminal sequence
		  AcSDKP, and depended only partially on its ability to bind
		  G-actin or to enter the nucleus.},

  abstract	= {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years
		  ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a
		  matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of
		  ≈24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly
		  suspected that a large fraction of these entries are
		  functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA
		  transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary
		  conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently
		  no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply
		  because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the
		  alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are
		  actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in
		  the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages.
		  Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the
		  nonconserved ORFs - specifically, their properties in other
		  primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are
		  random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a
		  major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the
		  number of protein-coding genes to ≈20,500. Specifically,
		  it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the
		  human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an
		  encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology
		  for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene
		  catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been

		  Mutagen sensitivity is a phenotype that reflects an

  abstract	= {Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a main catechin of
		  green tea, has been suggested to inhibit hepatic
		  gluconeogenesis. However, the exact role and related
		  mechanism have not been established. In this study, we
		  examined the role of EGCG in hepatic gluconeogenesis at
		  concentrations that are reachable by ingestion of pure EGCG
		  or green tea, and are not toxic to hepatocytes. Our results
		  show in isolated hepatocytes that EGCG at relatively low
		  concentrations (≤ 1 $\mu$M) inhibited glucose production
		  via gluconeogenesis and expression of key gluconeogenic
		  genes. EGCG was not toxic at these concentrations while
		  demonstrating significant cytotoxicity at 10 $\mu$M and
		  higher concentrations. EGCG at 1 $\mu$M or lower
		  concentrations effective in suppressing hepatic
		  gluconeogenesis did not activate the insulin signaling
		  pathway, but activated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase
		  (AMPK). The EGCG suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis was
		  prevented by blockade of AMPK activity. In defining the
		  mechanism by which EGCG activates AMPK, we found that the
		  EGCG activation of AMPK was mediated by the
		  Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK).
		  Furthermore, our results show that the EGCG activation of
		  AMPK and EGCG suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis were
		  both dependent on production of reactive oxygen species
		  (ROS), which was a known activator of CaMKK. Together, our
		  results demonstrate an inhibitory role for EGCG in hepatic
		  gluconeogenesis and shed new light on the mechanism by
		  which EGCG suppresses gluconeogenesis.},

  abstract	= {Unlike normal differentiated cells, tumor cells metabolize
		  glucose via glycolysis under aerobic conditions, a hallmark
		  of cancer known as the Warburg effect. Cells lacking the
		  commonly mutated tumor suppressor PTEN exhibit a glycolytic
		  phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. This has been
		  traditionally attributed to the hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt
		  signaling that results from PTEN loss. Here, we propose a
		  novel mechanism whereby the loss of PTEN negatively affects
		  the activity of the E3 ligase APC/C-Cdh1, resulting in the
		  stabilization of the enzyme PFKFB3 and increased synthesis
		  of its product fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2). We
		  discovered that when compared with wild-type cells, PTEN
		  knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PTEN KO MEF) have
		  2-3-fold higher concentrations of F2,6P2, the most potent
		  allosteric activator of the glycolytic enzyme
		  phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Reintroduction of either
		  wild-type or phosphatase mutant PTEN in the PTEN KO cells
		  effectively lowers F2,6P2 to the wild-type levels and
		  reduces their lactate production. PTEN KO cells were found
		  to have high protein levels of PFKFB3, which directly
		  contribute to the increased concentrations of F2,6P2. PTEN
		  enhances interaction between PFKFB3 and Cdh1, and
		  overexpression of Cdh1 down-regulates the PFKFB3 protein
		  level in wild-type, but not in PTEN-deficient cells.
		  Importantly, we found that the degradation of endogenous
		  PFKFB3 in PTEN KO cells occurs at a slower rate than in
		  wild-type cells. Our results suggest an important role for
		  F2,6P2 in the metabolic reprogramming of PTEN-deficient
		  cells that has important consequences for cell
		  proliferation.},

  abstract	= {The insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 mediates
		  the uptake of glucose into adipocytes and muscle cells. In
		  this study we have used a novel 96-well plate fluorescence
		  assay to study the kinetics of GLUT4 trafficking in 3T3-L1
		  adipocytes. We have found evidence for a graded release
		  mechanism whereby GLUT4 is released into the plasma
		  membrane recycling system in a nonkinetic manner as
		  follows: the kinetics of appearance of GLUT4 at the plasma
		  membrane is independent of the insulin concentration; a
		  large proportion of GLUT4 molecules do not participate in
		  plasma membrane recycling in the absence of insulin; and
		  with increasing insulin there is an incremental increase in
		  the total number of GLUT4 molecules participating in the
		  recycling pathway rather than simply an increased rate of
		  recycling. We propose a model whereby GLUT4 is stored in a
		  compartment that is disengaged from the plasma membrane
		  recycling system in the basal state. In response to
		  insulin, GLUT4 is quantally released from this compartment
		  in a pulsatile manner, leaving some sequestered from the
		  recycling pathway even in conditions of excess insulin.
		  Once disengaged from this location we suggest that in the

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: About 15{\%} of men experience prostate specific
		  antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy. A DNA
		  methylation based molecular test could provide important
		  information to predict which patients are most likely to
		  experience recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed
		  a genome-wide scan to find aberrantly methylated loci in
		  prostate cancer from patients with early recurrence, high
		  Gleason score or advanced stage. We discovered 441
		  candidate methylation markers and further analyzed 62
		  candidates in a methylation microarray study of 304 frozen
		  prostatectomy samples. RESULTS: Methylation of 25 markers
		  was significantly changed in high Gleason score (8-10) vs
		  low Gleason score (2-6) cancers. Methylation levels of the
		  3 marker candidates GPR7, ABHD9 and an expressed sequence
		  tag on chromosome 3 (Chr3-EST) were significantly increased
		  in patients who did vs did not experience early PSA
		  recurrence (Bonferroni correction p{\textless}0.05).
		  Furthermore, these markers were also informative when the
		  sample set was restricted to 68 mid range Gleason score (6
		  or 7) samples only. We developed real-time polymerase chain
		  reaction assays for ABHD9 and Chr3-EST, and measured
		  methylation in paraffin embedded, formalin fixed
		  prostatectomy samples from an independent set of 223
		  patients. Methylation of the 2 markers was significantly
		  higher in patients with early PSA recurrence compared to
		  that in patients who did not experience PSA recurrence.
		  CONCLUSIONS: We report that methylation of the 3 novel
		  markers GPR7, ABHD9 and Chr3-EST is significantly
		  associated with prostate cancer prognosis. Incorporation of
		  these methylation markers into clinical practice will
		  result in more accurate prediction of which patients are

		  interesting predictors of radioresistance, although their
		  exact influence awaits confirmation on a large cohort of
		  uniformly treated patients. METHODS. In a retrospective
		  cohort of 304 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
		  head and neck who were treated with radical radiotherapy,
		  the expression levels of p53 and Ki-67 were assessed by
		  immunohistochemistry. Local control and survival curves
		  were generated for p53 and Ki-67 using the Kaplan-Meier
		  method. The difference between curves was calculated in
		  univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS. The
		  overexpression of p53 was associated with local treatment
		  failure (P = 0.01) but not with survival (P = 0.09). In a
		  Cox analysis, p53 overexpression remained an independent
		  predictor of local failure, with a relative risk of local
		  failure of 1.5 (P = 0.05). Low proliferation (Ki-67
		  {\textless} 20{\%}) was a significant factor in local
		  failure for patients with tumors of the oral cavity only (P
		  = 0.01). Patients with both unfavorable immunohistochemical
		  markers (p53 overexpression and low proliferation) had a
		  45{\%} rate of local control compared with a 67{\%} rate
		  for all other combinations (P = 0.002). This association
		  was even more significant in patients with T1-T2 lesions
		  (45{\%} vs. 77{\%}; P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS. The results
		  support the role of p53 as an independent predictor of
		  local failure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of
		  the head and neck who are treated by radical radiotherapy,
		  suggesting that it may predict radioresistance. Combined
		  with p53, Ki-67 may help in the better selection of
		  patients for radiotherapy, especially for patients with
		  early-stage tumors. Prospective studies are now needed to
		  confirm these results and to define better the role of

  abstract	= {AIMS: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with
		  endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD).
		  The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-enzyme
		  Q10 (CoQ) supplementation, which is an obligatory coenzyme
		  in the mitochondrial respiratory transport chain, can
		  reverse MD and improve endothelial function in patients
		  with ischaemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction
		  (LVSD).
		  
		  METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a randomized,
		  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the
		  effects of CoQ supplement (300 mg/day, n=28) vs. placebo
		  (controls, n=28) for 8 weeks on brachial flow-mediated
		  dilation (FMD) in patients with ischaemic LVSD(left
		  ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}45{\%}).
		  Mitochondrial function was determined by plasma
		  lactate/pyruvate ratio (LP ratio). After 8 weeks,
		  CoQ-treated patients had significant increases in plasma
		  CoQ concentration (treatment effect 2.20 $\mu$g/mL,
		  P{\textless}0.001) and FMD (treatment effect 1.51{\%},
		  P=0.03); and decrease in LP ratio (treatment effect -2.46,
		  P=0.03) compared with controls. However, CoQ treatment did
		  not alter nitroglycerin-mediated dilation, blood pressure,
		  blood levels of fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c, lipid
		  profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and oxidative
		  stress as determined by serum superoxide dismutase and
		  8-isoprostane (all P{\textgreater}0.05). Furthermore, the
		  reduction in LP ratio significantly correlated with
		  improvement in FMD (r=-0.29, P=0.047).
		  
		  CONCLUSION: In patients with ischaemic LVSD, 8 weeks
		  supplement of CoQ improved mitochondrial function and FMD;
		  and the improvement of FMD correlated with the change in
		  mitochondrial function, suggesting that CoQ improved
		  endothelial function via reversal of mitochondrial
		  dysfunction in patients with ischaemic LVSD.},

  abstract	= {The ability of cancer cells to overproduce lactic acid
		  aerobically was recognized by Warburg about seven decades
		  ago, although its molecular basis has been elusive.
		  Increases in glucose transport and hexokinase activity in
		  cancer cells appear to account for the increased flux of
		  glucose through the cancer cells. Herein we review current
		  findings indicating that the c-Myc oncogenic transcription
		  factor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) are able to
		  bind the lactate dehydrogenase A promoter cis acting
		  elements, which resemble the core carbohydrate response
		  element (ChoRE), CACGTG. These and other observations
		  suggest that the normal cell responds physiologically to
		  changes in oxygen tension or the availability of glucose by
		  altering glycolysis through the ChoRE, which hypothetically
		  binds c-Myc, HIF-1, or related factors. The neoplastic cell
		  is hypothesized to augment glycolysis by activation of
		  ChoRE/ HIF-1 sites through direct interaction with c-Myc or
		  through activation of HIF-1 or HIF-1-like activity. We
		  hypothesize that oncogene products either stimulate HIF-1
		  and related factors or, in the case of c-Myc, directly
		  activate hypoxia/glucose responsive elements in glycolytic
		  enzyme genes to increase the ability of cancer cells to
		  undergo aerobic glycolysis.},

  abstract	= {Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy
		  we demonstrate that thymosin beta(4) (tbeta(4)) binding
		  induces spatial rearrangements within the small domain
		  (subdomains 1 and 2) of actin monomers in solution.
		  Tbeta(4) binding increases the distance between probes
		  attached to Gln-41 and Cys-374 of actin by 2 A and
		  decreases the distance between the purine base of bound ATP
		  (epsilonATP) and Lys-61 by 1.9 A, whereas the distance

		  determinations are consistent with tbeta(4) binding being

		  scanning calorimetry, tbeta(4) binding increases the
		  cooperativity of ATP-actin monomer denaturation, consistent
		  with conformational rearrangements in the tbeta(4)-actin
		  complex. Changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer
		  are accompanied by marked reduction in solvent

  abstract	= {Background: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a pool of
		  molecular data sets publicly accessible and freely
		  available to cancer researchers anywhere around the world.
		  However, wide spread use is limited since an advanced
		  knowledge of statistics and statistical software is
		  required. Results: In order to improve accessibility we
		  created Web-TCGA, a web based, freely accessible online
		  tool, which can also be run in a private instance, for
		  integrated analysis of molecular cancer data sets provided
		  by TCGA. In contrast to already available tools, Web-TCGA
		  utilizes different methods for analysis and visualization
		  of TCGA data, allowing users to generate global molecular
		  profiles across different cancer entities simultaneously.
		  In addition to global molecular profiles, Web-TCGA offers
		  highly detailed gene and tumor entity centric analysis by
		  providing interactive tables and views. Conclusions: As a
		  supplement to other already available tools, such as
		  cBioPortal (Sci Signal 6:pl1, 2013, Cancer Discov 2:401-4,
		  2012), Web-TCGA is offering an analysis service, which does
		  not require any installation or configuration, for
		  molecular data sets available at the TCGA. Individual
		  processing requests (queries) are generated by the user for
		  mutation, methylation, expression and copy number variation
		  (CNV) analyses. The user can focus analyses on results from
		  single genes and cancer entities or perform a global

		  data analysis results publicly available through a

		  infrastructure, a combination of free and publicly
		  available web services, facilitates the development of API
		  clients. It decouples changes in server software from the
		  client software by reacting to changes in the RESTful
		  service and removing direct dependencies on a specific
		  implementation of an API. As a second result, FirebrowseR,
		  an R client to the Broad Institute's RESTful Firehose

  abstract	= {Background: MEDI1873 is a novel GITR-ligand/IgG1 agonist
		  fusion protein that binds the co-stimulatory
		  glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family-related protein
		  (GITR) on CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells and regulatory T
		  cells. This Phase 1 study evaluated safety, maximum
		  tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK),
		  immunogenicity, immunomodulatory effects and preliminary
		  antitumor activity in pts with advanced solid tumors.
		  Methods: MEDI1873 was administered IV Q2W. During dose
		  escalation (DE), it was evaluated in 2 single pt cohorts
		  (1.5 and 3 mg), followed by 3+3 DE in 6 cohorts (7.5, 25,
		  75, 250, 500 and 750 mg). Pts with NSCLC, HNSCC or CRC
		  receiving 75 or 250 mg were evaluated in pharmacodynamic
		  (PD) cohorts using biopsies pretreatment and at day 29. All
		  pts had flow cytometric assessment of lymphocytes pre- and
		  on-treatment up to day 43. Antitumor response was assessed
		  using RECIST v 1.1. Results: As of 1 March 2018, 40 pts
		  were dosed in the DE (28) and PD (12) cohorts. An MTD was
		  not reached (maximum administered dose was 750 mg). Three
		  DLTs occurred: Grade 3 worsening tumor pain at 250 mg,
		  Grade 3 nausea and vomiting at 500 mg and Grade 3 non-STEMI
		  at 750 mg. Any-grade drug-related AEs occurred in 82.5{\%}
		  of pts, most commonly headache (25{\%}) and infusion
		  related reaction (IRR, 20{\%}). Grade 3 drug-related AEs
		  occurred in 22.5{\%} of pts; amylase increase was the only
		  one reported in{\textgreater}1 pt (n=2). There were no
		  drug-related Grade 4 or 5 AEs. PK was dose-proportional
		  over a range of 1.5 to 500 mg; elimination half-life was
		  approximately 2 days. Anti-drug antibody incidence was low
		  with minimal PK impact. MEDI1873 engaged GITR on CD4+ T
		  cells and increased CD4+Ki67+ T cells at doses ≥25 mg.
		  Intratumorally, MEDI1873 induced a≥25{\%} decrease in
		  GITR+/FOXP3+ T cells in 5 of 5 pts with evaluable cells.
		  Immune PD changes were observed in 8 pts who underwent
		  paired biopsies. Best overall response was stable disease
		  (SD) in 42.5{\%} of pts; 17.5{\%} had SD≥24 weeks. Three
		  pts (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, lung cancer and
		  mesothelioma) stayed on MEDI1873 for ≥52 weeks without
		  progression. Conclusions: MEDI1873 has an acceptable safety
		  profile in heavily pretreated pts with solid tumors. PD
		  changes in blood and tumor coupled with prolonged SD in
		  several pts support further clinical exploration of doses
		  ≥250 mg.},

		  including oral squamous cell carcinomas. This study was
		  performed to evaluate the relationship of immunoexpression
		  of p53 protein in series of 91 squamous cell carcinomas of
		  the oral cavity with clinicopathologic parameters and to
		  investigate whether p53 immunoexpression might influence
		  the clinical outcome of the disease. Methods. From a group
		  of 287 consecutive patients, 91 surgically treated ones
		  were randomly selected. P53 protein expression was
		  investigated by means of immunohistochemistry. Clinical and
		  histopathologic data were gathered, and the patient
		  survival was analyzed. Results. Of the oral carcinomas,
		  52.7{\%} (n = 48) overexpressed p53, using a threshold of
		  10{\%} stained cell nuclei. There was a negative
		  correlation of p53 immunoexpression with a histologic grade
		  of differentiation (r= -0.236, p =.06) but not with
		  clinical variables. Overall survival rate was 59{\%} at 5
		  years. In univariate analysis, tumor size, node status, and
		  advanced clinical stage were significantly associated with
		  shortened overall survival. In patients without neck node
		  metastases, p53 showed a strong correlation with survival
		  (p = .01). In multivariate analysis performed only on NO
		  patients, tumor extension and p53 immunoexpression were
		  found to be the only independent prognostic parameters with
		  relative risks of 1.9 and 4.3, respectively. Conclusions. A
		  strong relationship was observed between p53
		  immunoexpression and poor prognosis in patients with oral
		  squamous cell carcinomas without neck node metastases.

  abstract	= {During the last decades a considerable amount of research
		  has been focused on cancer. Recently, tumor cell metabolism
		  has been considered as a possible target for cancer

		  glycolytic activity and impaired oxidative phosphorylation
		  (Warburg effect). Therefore, it seems reasonable that
		  disruption of glycolysis might be a promising candidate for
		  specific anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the concept of
		  aerobic glycolysis as the paradigm of tumor cell metabolism
		  has been challenged, as some tumor cells exhibit high rates
		  of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial physiology in
		  cancer cells is linked to the Warburg effect. Besides, its
		  central role in apoptosis makes this organelle a promising
		  "dual hit target" to selectively eliminate tumor cells.
		  From a metabolic point of view, the fermenting yeast
		  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and tumor cells share several

		  suggests that some subunits can directly exchange in
		  holo-CI. Presently, data on the kinetics of these two
		  incorporation modes for individual CI subunits during CI
		  maintenance are sparse. Here, we used inducible HEK293 cell
		  lines stably expressing AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits and
		  quantified the amount of tagged subunit in mitoplasts and

		  determine their CI incorporation efficiency. Analysis of

		  patterns. A first pattern, represented by NDUFS1, showed
		  overlapping time courses, indicating that imported subunits
		  predominantly incorporate into holo-CI. A second pattern,
		  represented by NDUFV1, consisted of parallel time courses,
		  which were, however, not quantitatively overlapping,
		  suggesting that imported subunits incorporate at similar
		  rates into holo-CI and CI assembly intermediates. The third
		  pattern, represented by NDUFS3 and NDUFA2, revealed a
		  delayed incorporation into holo-CI, suggesting their prior
		  appearance in CI assembly intermediates and/or as free
		  monomers. Our analysis showed the same maximum
		  incorporation into holo-CI for NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS1,
		  NDUFS3, NDUFS4, NDUFA2, and NDUFA12 with nearly complete
		  loss of endogenous subunit at 24 h of induction, indicative
		  of an equimolar stoichiometry and unexpectedly rapid

		  association between surgical excision margins of patients
		  with OSCC and outcomes of disease-free and overall
		  survival. Materials and Methods The authors implemented a
		  retrospective cohort study. The sample was composed of
		  patients with OSCC having resection as their initial
		  treatment. The predictor variable was the pathologic
		  surgical margin, defined as clear ({\textgreater}5 mm),
		  close (1 to 5 mm), or involved ({\textless}1 mm). The
		  outcome variables were disease-free (absence of
		  locoregional recurrence) and overall survival. Data were
		  analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox
		  regression hazard model. Results The sample was composed of
		  54 patients with a mean age of 60.5 years (range, 19 to 85
		  yr) and 26{\%} were women. The 2- and 5-year overall
		  survival rates were 59 and 50{\%}, respectively. The clear
		  surgical margin group showed higher disease-free survival

		  probability, 0.78 vs 0.43 and 0.29; P =.014) and a trend
		  toward increased overall survival at 2 and 5 years (P
		  =.093). Conclusion The results suggest that the presence of
		  a close surgical margin (1 to 5 mm) is an adverse risk
		  feature comparable to an involved margin and therefore is
		  associated with decreased disease-free and overall
		  survival. Future studies are needed to replicate these
		  findings before they can be used as a basis for clinical

  abstract	= {Recent studies have shown that hyperinsulinemia may
		  increase the cancer risk. Moreover, many tumors demonstrate
		  an increased activation of IR signaling pathways.
		  Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is necessary for
		  insulin action. In epithelial cells, which do not express
		  GLUT4 and gluconeogenic enzymes, insulin-mediated PI3K
		  activation regulates cell survival, growth, and motility.
		  Although the involvement of the regulatory subunit of PI3K
		  (p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)) in insulin signal transduction has
		  been extensively studied, the function of its N-terminus
		  remains elusive. It has been identified as a serine (S83)
		  in the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K) that is phosphorylated by protein
		  kinase A (PKA). To determine the molecular mechanism
		  linking PKA to insulin-mediated PI3K activation, we used
		  p85$\alpha$ (PI3K) mutated forms to prevent phosphorylation
		  (p85A) or to mimic the phosphorylated residue (p85D). We
		  demonstrated that phosphorylation of p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)S83
		  modulates the formation of the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)/IRS-1
		  complex and its subcellular localization influencing the
		  kinetics of the insulin signaling both on MAPK-ERK and AKT
		  pathways. Furthermore, the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)S83
		  phosphorylation plays a central role in the control of

		  fusion protein that binds to the co-stimulatory molecule
		  GITR, which is upregulated on activated T cells. This Phase
		  1 study (NCT02583165) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics,
		  pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity in
		  patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods MEDI1873 was
		  administered IV Q2W in sequential dose escalation (DE)
		  cohorts: 2 single patient cohorts (1.5 and 3 mg), followed
		  by six 3+3 DE cohorts (7.5, 25, 75, 250, 500 and 750 mg).
		  Antitumor response was assessed using RECIST v 1.1.
		  Pharmacodynamic cohorts of patients with non-small cell
		  lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
		  or colorectal cancer receiving 75 or 250 mg were evaluated
		  for intratumoral CD8, FOXP3, GITR and tumoral PD-L1
		  expression by immunohistochemistry using matched biopsies
		  from pretreatment and day 29. Peripheral blood from all
		  patients was monitored for type-2 IFN cytokine levels, gene
		  expression, and lymphocyte phenotype by flow cytometry up
		  to day 43. Results As of 1 March 2018, 40 patients have
		  been dosed in the DE (28) and pharmacodynamic (12) cohorts.
		  MEDI1873 elimination half-life was {\~{}}2.0 days. MEDI1873
		  pharmacokinetics was dose-proportional over a range of 1.5
		  to 500 mg. Antidrug antibodies were rare and had minimal
		  impact on pharmacokinetics. MEDI1873 engaged GITR as
		  evidenced by {\textgreater}50{\%} reductions in peripheral
		  GITR-expressing memory CD4+ T cells using a competitive
		  target engagement assay. The duration of GITR+ T-cell
		  suppression correlated with MEDI1873 dose. At doses ≥75
		  mg, peripheral IFN$\gamma$, IP-10, I-TAC and MIG were
		  elevated on days 2 and 3. This was followed by increased
		  Ki67+CD4+ T cells on day 15. Additionally, patients with
		  high baseline GITR levels (≥ median) had a sustained
		  elevation of Ki67+CD4+ T cells to Day 43. Of 8 patients
		  with evaluable paired tumor biopsies, one patient with HPV+
		  HNSCC and the highest baseline GITR on CD4+ T cells showed
		  a 2x increase in intratumoral CD8+ and tumoral PD-L1+
		  cells. Intratumorally, MEDI1873 induced a ≥25{\%}
		  reduction in GITR+/FOXP3+ T cells in 5 of 5 evaluable
		  patients. Patients with prolonged stable disease (≥40
		  weeks) had an average 2x elevation in Ki67+CD4+ peripheral
		  T cells compared to all other patients. Conclusions
		  MEDI1873 engages GITR on circulating blood cells resulting
		  in increased peripheral IFN$\gamma$ production and
		  CD4+memory T-cell proliferation coupled with a decrease in
		  intratumoral GITR+/FOXP3+ cells. These pharmacodynamic
		  effects are consistent with the compound's mechanism of
		  action and may be enhanced in patients with high baseline
		  GITR expression.},

  abstract	= {Rcpp is the glue that binds the power and versatility of R
		  with the speed and efficiency of C++. With Rcpp, the
		  transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and
		  high-performance statistical computing is finally
		  accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every
		  statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School
		  of Management "Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp" is
		  simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R,
		  it is an indispensable resource. The writing is
		  outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications.
		  This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen
		  and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which
		  enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are
		  what most of us need to know to really do scientific
		  programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert
		  McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business
		  Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody
		  doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book
		  is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a
		  gentle introduction to more advanced applications via
		  numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book
		  is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about
		  Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.),
		  modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book
		  is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA
		  Anderson School of Management The Rcpp package represents a
		  major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With
		  very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures
		  readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence,
		  high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost
		  as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain.
		  Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his
		  book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to
		  using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! --
		  S{\o}ren H{\o}jsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences,
		  Aalborg University, Denmark "Seamless R and C ++
		  Integration with Rcpp" provides the first comprehensive
		  introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used
		  language extension for R, and is deployed by over
		  one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp
		  permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or
		  entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with
		  ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework
		  together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++. Dirk
		  Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a
		  decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the
		  Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative
		  software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and
		  High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual
		  R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of
		  Statistical Software. He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematical
		  Economics from EHESS (Paris), and works in Chicago as a

  abstract	= {Abstract Background Resecting oral squamous cell carcinoma
		  (SCC) with an appropriate margin of uninvolved tissue is
		  critical in preventing local recurrence and in making
		  decisions regarding postoperative radiation therapy. This
		  task can be difficult due to the discrepancy between
		  margins measured intraoperatively and those measured
		  microscopically by the pathologist after specimen
		  processing. Material and methods A total of 61 patients
		  underwent resective surgery with curative intent for
		  primary oral SCC were included in this study. All patients
		  underwent resection of the tumor with a measured 1-cm
		  margin. Specimens were then submitted for processing and
		  reviewing, and histopathologic margins were measured. The
		  closest histopathologic margin was compared with the in
		  situ margin (1 cm) to determine the percentage discrepancy.
		  Results The mean discrepancy between the in situ margins
		  and the histopathological margins of all close and positive
		  margins were 47.6{\%} for the buccal mucosa (with a P value
		  corresponding to 0.05 equaling 2.1), which is statistically
		  significant, 4.8{\%} for the floor of mouth, 9.5{\%} for
		  the mandibular alveolus, 4.8{\%} for the retromolar trigon,
		  and 33.3{\%} for the tongue. Conclusion There is a
		  significant difference among resection margins based on
		  tumor anatomical location. Margins shrinkage after
		  resection and processing should be considered at the time
		  of the initial resection. Tumors located in the buccal
		  mucosa show significantly greater discrepancies than tumors
		  at other sites. These findings suggest that it is critical
		  to consider the oral site when outlining margins to ensure
		  adequacy of resection. Buccal SCC is an aggressive disease,
		  and should be considered as an aggressive subsite within
		  the oral cavity, requiring a radical and aggressive
		  resective approach.},

		  proposes that H(+) diffuses from the proximal tumor
		  microenvironment into adjacent normal tissues where it
		  causes tissue remodeling that permits local invasion. In
		  the current work, tumor invasion and peritumoral pH were
		  monitored over time using intravital microscopy. In every
		  case, the peritumoral pH was acidic and heterogeneous and

		  functional relevance in cancer, we select 40 for further

		  frequent mutations (14 of 90, 15{\%}) in CTNNA2 and
		  CTNNA3-encoding $\alpha$-catenins. Functional studies
		  reveal an increase in the migration and invasive ability of
		  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells producing
		  mutated forms of CTNNA2 and CTNNA3 or in cells where both
		  $\alpha$-catenins are silenced. Analysis of the clinical

  abstract	= {Autophagy is a highly conserved process involved in
		  lymphocyte development and differentiation. Herein, we
		  demonstrated for the first time that triggering of TRPV1 by
		  the specific agonist CPS induces autophagy in mouse
		  thymocytes. TRPV1-dependent autophagy required [Ca(2+)](i)
		  and ROS generation, resulting in AMPK activation. CPS
		  specifically increased Atg4C mRNA expression and induced
		  oxidation of Atg4C protein by ROS generation.
		  TRPV1-triggered autophagy was Atg6/Beclin-1-dependent, as
		  demonstrated by the use of Beclin-1(+/-) transgenic mice,
		  and involved ROS- and AMPK-mediated up-regulation of
		  Beclin-1 expression. Autophagy is activated as a
		  prosurvival process, as its inhibition triggered apoptosis
		  of thymocytes: this effect was accompanied by
		  down-regulation of Atg4C, Bcl-X(L), and Irgm1 mRNA
		  expression, decreased Bcl-X(L) and Beclin-1 protein levels,
		  and caspase-3 activation, suggesting the existence of a
		  molecular interplay between autophagic and apoptotic
		  programs. TRPV1 activation by CPS altered the expression of
		  CD4 and CD8$\alpha$ antigens, inducing the development of
		  DP(dull). Interestingly, we found that CPS induces
		  autophagy of DP(dull) cells, and inhibition of CPS-induced
		  autophagy by the 3-MA autophagic inhibitor induces
		  apoptosis of DP(dull) cells, suggesting the presence of an
		  interplay between autophagic survival and apoptotic cell
		  death. Overall, our findings suggest that DP(dull) cells
		  constitute a distinct thymocyte subpopulation involved in
		  the homeostatic control of cellularity and in the responses
		  to chemical stress signals during thymocyte maturation, via
		  regulating autophagy and apoptosis in a TRPV1-dependent

  abstract	= {Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an
		  aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate
		  {\textless}7{\%} and is ultimately refractory to most
		  treatments. To date, an assessment of immunologic factors
		  relevant to disease has not been comprehensively performed
		  for treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients. We hypothesized that
		  systemic immunologic biomarkers could predict overall
		  survival (OS) in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve PDAC patients.
		  Experimental Design: Peripheral blood was collected from 73
		  patients presenting with previously untreated metastatic
		  PDAC. Extensive immunologic profiling was conducted to
		  assess relationships between OS and the level of soluble
		  plasma biomarkers or detailed immune cell phenotypes as
		  measured by flow cytometry. Results: Higher baseline levels
		  of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL6 and IL10 were
		  strongly associated with poorer OS (P = 0.008 and 0.026,
		  respectively; HR = 1.16 and 1.28, respectively), whereas
		  higher levels of the monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1 were
		  associated with significantly longer OS (P = 0.045; HR =
		  0.69). Patients with a greater proportion of
		  antigen-experienced T cells (CD45RO+ )hadlongerOS(CD4 P =
		  0.032; CD8 P = 0.036; HR = 0.36 and 0.61, respectively).
		  Although greater expression of the T-cell checkpoint
		  molecule CTLA-4 on CD8+ T cells was associated with
		  significantly shorter OS (P = 0.020; HR = 1.53), the TIM3
		  molecule had a positive association with survival when
		  expressed on CD4+ T cells (P = 0.046; HR = 0.62).
		  Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that
		  baseline immune status predicts PDAC disease course and
		  overall patient survival. To our knowledge, this work
		  represents the largest cohort and most comprehensive immune
		  profiling of treatment-na{\"{i}}ve metastatic PDAC patients

		  (1) Long-term ethanol exposure decreased activated AMPK,

		  (2) In rat and human adipocytes, AICAR-induced AMPK
		  activation, with subsequent elevation of MEF2 and GLUT4

		  CONCLUSION: The AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway exists in both rat

		  regulate MEF2 and GLUT4 expression. Ethanol inhibition of
		  this pathway leads to decreased GLUT4 expression, thus
		  reducing insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.},

		  In normal brain, glucose is an essential neuronal fuel, but

		  outcompete for glucose uptake by co-opting the high

		  SLC2A3). BTICs preferentially express Glut3, and targeting
		  Glut3 inhibits BTIC growth and tumorigenic potential.
		  Glut3, but not Glut1, correlates with poor survival in
		  brain tumors and other cancers; thus, tumor initiating
		  cells may extract nutrients with high affinity. As altered

  abstract	= {UNLABELLED: Chronic inflammation plays a fundamental role
		  in tumor promotion, migration, and invasion. With the use
		  of microarray profiling, a profound increase was observed
		  for those transcripts involved in proinflammatory signaling
		  in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
		  inhibitor-treated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC) cells as compared with their respective controls.
		  As such, it was hypothesized that EGFR inhibitor efficacy
		  is offset by the proinflammatory response that these
		  therapeutics conjure in HNSCC. Systematic evaluation of the
		  clinical EGFR inhibitors-erlotinib, cetuximab, lapatinib,
		  and panitumumab-revealed increased secretion of
		  proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL-2, IL-4,
		  IL-6, IL-8), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
		  factor, TNF-$\alpha$, and IFN-$\gamma$. Mechanistic focus
		  on IL-6 revealed that erlotinib induced a time-dependent
		  increase in IL-6 mRNA and protein expression. Importantly,
		  exogenous IL-6 protected HNSCC cells from erlotinib-induced
		  cytotoxicity, whereas tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor
		  antagonist, sensitized cells to erlotinib in vitro and in
		  vivo. Inhibitors of NF-$\kappa$B, p38, and JNK suppressed
		  erlotinib-induced IL-6 expression, suggesting critical
		  roles for NF-$\kappa$B and MAPK in IL-6 regulation.
		  Furthermore, knockdown of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) suppressed
		  erlotinib-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression.
		  Taken together, these results demonstrate that clinical
		  EGFR inhibitors induce the expression of proinflammatory
		  cytokines via NOX4.
		  
		  IMPLICATIONS: The antitumor activity of EGFR inhibitors is
		  reduced by activation of NOX4-mediated proinflammatory

@Article{	  flores2012,
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant
		  bone tumor in children and adolescents. The survival rate
		  of patients with metastatic disease remains very dismal.
		  Nevertheless, metastasis is a complex process and a
		  single-level analysis is not likely to identify its key
		  biological determinants. In this study, we used a systems
		  biology approach to identify common metastatic pathways
		  that are jointly supported by both mRNA and protein
		  expression data in two distinct human metastatic OS models.
		  
		  RESULTS: mRNA expression microarray and N-linked
		  glycoproteomic analyses were performed on two commonly used
		  isogenic pairs of human metastatic OS cell lines, namely
		  HOS/143B and SaOS-2/LM7. Pathway analysis of the
		  differentially regulated genes and glycoproteins separately
		  revealed pathways associated to metastasis including cell
		  cycle regulation, immune response, and
		  epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition. However, no common
		  significant pathway was found at both genomic and proteomic
		  levels between the two metastatic models, suggesting a very
		  different biological nature of the cell lines. To address
		  this issue, we used a topological significance analysis
		  based on a "shortest-path" algorithm to identify
		  topological nodes, which uncovered additional biological
		  information with respect to the genomic and glycoproteomic
		  profiles but remained hidden from the direct analyses.
		  Pathway analysis of the significant topological nodes
		  revealed a striking concordance between the models and
		  identified significant common pathways, including
		  "Cytoskeleton remodeling/TGF/WNT", "Cytoskeleton
		  remodeling/Cytoskeleton remodeling", and "Cell
		  adhesion/Chemokines and adhesion". Of these, the
		  "Cytoskeleton remodeling/TGF/WNT" was the top ranked common
		  pathway from the topological analysis of the genomic and
		  proteomic profiles in the two metastatic models. The
		  up-regulation of proteins in the "Cytoskeleton
		  remodeling/TGF/WNT" pathway in the SaOS-2/LM7 and HOS/143B
		  models was further validated using an orthogonal Reverse
		  Phase Protein Array platform.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used a systems biology
		  approach by integrating genomic and proteomic data to
		  identify key and common metastatic mechanisms in OS. The
		  use of the topological analysis revealed hidden biological
		  pathways that are known to play critical roles in
		  metastasis. Wnt signaling has been previously implicated in
		  OS and other tumors, and inhibitors of Wnt signaling
		  pathways are available for clinical testing. Further
		  characterization of this common pathway and other
		  topological pathways identified from this study may lead to
		  a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
		  metastatic OS.},

  abstract	= {The insulin-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4)
		  translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin
		  in order to facilitate the postprandial uptake of glucose
		  into fat and muscle cells. While early insulin receptor
		  signaling steps leading to this translocation are well
		  defined, the integration of signaling and regulation of
		  GLUT4 traffic remains elusive. Several lines of evidence
		  suggest an important role for the actin cytoskeleton and
		  for protein-protein interactions in regulating GLUT4
		  localization by insulin. Here, we applied stable isotope
		  labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to identify
		  proteins that interact with GLUT4 in an insulin-regulated
		  manner. Myc-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4myc) stably expressed in L6
		  myotubes was immunoprecipitated via the myc epitope from
		  total membranes isolated from basal and insulin-stimulated
		  cells grown in medium containing normal isotopic abundance
		  leucine or deuterated leucine, respectively. Proteins
		  coprecipitating with GLUT4myc were analyzed by liquid
		  chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. Of 603 proteins
		  quantified, 36 displayed an insulin-dependent change of
		  their interaction with GLUT4myc of more than 1.5-fold in
		  either direction. Several cytoskeleton-related proteins
		  were elevated in immunoprecipates from insulin-treated
		  cells, whereas components of the ubiquitin-proteasome
		  degradation system were generally reduced. Proteins
		  participating in vesicle traffic also displayed
		  insulin-regulated association. Of cytoskeleton-related
		  proteins, alpha-actinin-4 recovery in GLUT4
		  immunoprecipitates rose in response to insulin 2.1 +/-
		  0.5-fold by SILAC and 2.9 +/- 0.8-fold by immunoblotting.
		  Insulin caused GLUT4 and alpha-actinin-4 co-localization as
		  revealed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We
		  conclude that insulin elicits changes in interactions
		  between diverse proteins and GLUT4, and that cytoskeletal
		  proteins, notably alpha-actinin-4, associate with the
		  transporter, potentially to facilitate its routing to the
		  plasma membrane.},

  abstract	= {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes treatments were related with
		  either an increased or reduced risk of cancer. There is
		  ongoing debate about a potential protective action of
		  metformin. To summarize evidence on the association between
		  metformin and risk of cancer and cancer mortality in
		  patients with diabetes.
		  
		  METHODS: Data source: MEDLINE and EMBASE (January
		  1966-April 2012). We selected randomized studies comparing
		  metformin and other hypoglycaemic agents and observational
		  studies exploring the association between exposure to
		  metformin and cancer. Outcomes were cancer mortality, all
		  malignancies and site-specific cancers.
		  
		  RESULTS: Of 25307 citations identified, 12 randomized
		  controlled trials (21,595 patients) and 41 observational
		  studies (1,029,389 patients) met the inclusion criteria. In
		  observational studies there was a significant association
		  of exposure to metformin with the risk of cancer death [6
		  studies, 24,410 patients, OR:0.65, 95{\%}CI: 0.53-0.80],
		  all malignancies [18 studies, 561,836 patients, OR:0.73,
		  95{\%}CI: 0.61-0.88], liver [8 studies, 312,742 patients,
		  OR:0.34; 95{\%}CI: 0.19-0.60] colorectal [12 studies,
		  871,365 patients, OR:0.83, 95{\%}CI: 0.74-0.92], pancreas
		  [9 studies, 847,248 patients, OR:0.56, 95{\%}CI:
		  0.36-0.86], stomach [2 studies, 100701 patients, OR:0.83,
		  95{\%}CI: 0.76-0.91], and esophagus cancer [2 studies,
		  100694 patients, OR:0.90, 95{\%}CI: 0.83-0.98]. No
		  significant difference of risk was observed in randomized
		  trials. Metformin was not associated with the risk of:
		  breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, uterus cancer,
		  prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, and
		  melanoma.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Results suggest that Metformin
		  might be associated with a significant reduction in the
		  risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Randomized
		  trials specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of
		  metformin as an anticancer agent are warranted.

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infection causes highly
		  contagious, severe respiratory disorders and gives rise to
		  thousands of deaths every year; however, the efficacy of
		  currently approved defense strategies, including vaccines
		  and neuraminidase inhibitors, is limited because the virus
		  frequently acquires resistance via antigen drift and
		  reassortment. It is therefore important to establish a
		  novel, effective therapeutic strategy that is effective
		  irrespective of viral subtype.
		  
		  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we identify the
		  Ras-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway as a
		  host-cell regulatory mechanism for influenza virus entry.
		  The binding of Ras to PI3K is specifically involved in
		  clathrin-independent endocytosis, endosomal maturation, and
		  intracellular transport of viruses, which result in
		  decreased infectious efficacy of different subtypes of
		  influenza viruses in cells lacking the Ras-PI3K
		  interaction. Moreover, influenza virus infection indeed
		  triggered Ras activation and subsequent PI3K activation in
		  early endosomes.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results
		  demonstrate that the Ras-PI3K signaling axis acts as a
		  host-oriented mechanism for viral internalization. Given
		  that virus incorporation is a process conserved among virus
		  subtypes and species, this signaling pathway may provide a
		  target for potent, well-tolerated prophylactics and
		  therapeutics against a broad range of viruses.},

		  credibility as a prognostic factor in different cancers.
		  Cox's proportional hazard (PH) model is usually used to
		  assess prognostic factors. However, this model imposes a
		  priori assumptions, which are rarely tested, that (1) the
		  hazard ratio associated with each prognostic factor remains
		  constant across the follow-up (PH assumption) and (2) the
		  relationship between a continuous predictor and the
		  logarithm of the mortality hazard is linear (linearity
		  assumption).
		  
		  METHODS: We tested these two assumptions of the Cox's PH
		  model for CRP, using a flexible statistical model, while
		  adjusting for other known prognostic factors, in a cohort
		  of 269 patients newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung
		  cancer (NSCLC).
		  
		  RESULTS: In the Cox's PH model, high CRP increased the risk
		  of death (HR=1.11 per each doubling of CRP value, 95{\%}
		  CI: 1.03-1.20, P=0.008). However, both the PH assumption
		  (P=0.033) and the linearity assumption (P=0.015) were
		  rejected for CRP, measured at the initiation of
		  chemotherapy, which kept its prognostic value for
		  approximately 18 months.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that flexible modeling
		  provides new insights regarding the value of CRP as a
		  prognostic factor in NSCLC and that Cox's PH model
		  underestimates early risks associated with high CRP.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: For evidence-based medical practice,
		  well-defined risk scoring systems are essential to identify
		  patients with a poor prognosis. The objective of this study
		  was to develop a prognostic score, the Montreal prognostic
		  score (MPS), to improve prognostication of patients with
		  incurable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in everyday
		  practice.
		  
		  METHODS: A training cohort (TC) and a confirmatory cohort
		  (CC) of newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC planning to
		  receive chemotherapy were used to develop the MPS. Stage
		  and clinically available biomarkers were entered into a Cox
		  model and risk weights were estimated. C-statistics were
		  used to test the accuracy.
		  
		  RESULTS: The TC consisted of 258 patients and the CC
		  consisted of 433 patients. Montreal prognostic score
		  classified patients into three distinct groups with median
		  survivals of 2.5 months (95{\%} confidence interval (CI):
		  1.8, 4.2), 8.2 months (95{\%} CI: 7.0, 9.4) and 18.2 months
		  (95{\%} CI: 14.0, 27.5), respectively (log-rank,

		  (95{\%} CI: 0.685, 0.697) for the TC and 0.665 (95{\%} CI:
		  0.661, 0.670) for the CC.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: The MPS, by classifying patients into three
		  well-defined prognostic groups, provides valuable
		  information, which physicians could use to better inform
		  their patients about treatment options, especially the best
		  timing to involve palliative care teams.},

  abstract	= {Tumor cells have an increased demand for nutrients; this
		  demand is met by increased availability of nutrients
		  through vasculogenesis and by enhanced cellular entry of
		  nutrients through upregulation of specific transporters.
		  This review focuses on three groups of nutrient
		  transporters relevant to cancer: glucose transporters,
		  lactate transporters, and amino acid transporters. Tumor
		  cells enhance glucose uptake via induction of GLUT1 and
		  SGLT1, and coordinate the increased entry of glucose with
		  increased glycolysis. Since enhanced glycolysis in cancer
		  is associated with lactate production, tumor cells must
		  find a way to eliminate lactic acid to prevent cellular
		  acidification. This is achieved by the upregulation of
		  MCT4, a H+-coupled lactate transporter. In addition, the
		  Na+-coupled lactate transporter SMCT1 is silenced in
		  cancer. SMCT1 also transports butyrate and pyruvate, which
		  are inhibitors of histone deacetylases. The silencing of
		  SMCT1 occurs in cancers of a variety of tissues.
		  Re-expression of SMCT1 in cancer cell lines leads to growth
		  arrest and apoptosis in the presence of butyrate or
		  pyruvate, suggesting that the transporter may function as a
		  tumor suppressor. Tumor cells meet their amino acid demands
		  by inducing xCT/4F2hc, LAT1/4F2hc, ASCT2, and ATB0,+.
		  xCT/4F2hc is related primarily to glutathione status,
		  protection against oxidative stress, and cell cycle
		  progression, whereas the other three transporters are
		  related to amino acid nutrition. Pharmacologic blockade of
		  LAT1/4F2hc, xCT/4F2hc, or ATB0,+ leads to inhibition of
		  cancer cell growth. Since tumor cells selectively regulate
		  these nutrient transporters to support their rapid growth,
		  these transporters have potential as drug targets for
		  cancer therapy.},

  abstract	= {Chromium(VI) (Cr(VI)) is widely used in industry and is a
		  potent inducer of tumors in animals. The present study
		  demonstrates that Cr(VI) induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1
		  (HIF-1) activity through the specific expression of
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ but not HIF-1$\beta$ subunit and increases
		  the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
		  expression in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. To
		  dissect the signaling pathways involved in Cr(VI)-induced
		  HIF-1 expression, we found that p38 mitogen-activated
		  protein kinase signaling was required for HIF-1$\alpha$
		  expression induced by Cr(VI). Neither phosphatidylinositol
		  3-kinase nor extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity
		  was required for Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1 expression. Cr(VI)
		  induced expression of HIF-1 and VEGF through the production
		  of reactive oxygen species in DU145 cells. The major
		  species of reactive oxygen species responsible for the
		  induction of HIF-1 and VEGF expression is H2O2. These
		  results suggest that the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF
		  induced by Cr(VI) may be an important signaling pathway in
		  the Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Most mutations of human
		  cancer are because of the activation of oncogenes and the
		  loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, which commonly
		  induce new blood vessels (angiogenesis) for tumors to grow
		  beyond a few millimeters in diameter (1, 2). Vascular
		  endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 is an essential protein
		  for angiogenesis (2, 3). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)
		  is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription
		  factor, composed of HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-1$\beta$/aryl
		  hydrocarbon nuclear translocator subunits (4).
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ is unique to HIF-1 and is induced
		  exponentially in response to a decrease in cellular O2
		  concentration (5). HIF-1$\beta$ is identical to the aryl
		  hydrocarbon nuclear translocator that forms a heterodimer
		  with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (4, 6) and is not
		  regulated by cellular oxygen tension (5). HIF-1 regulates
		  the expression of many genes including VEGF,
		  erythropoietin, heme oxygenase 1, aldolase, enolase, and
		  lactate dehydrogenase A (7). The levels of HIF-1 activity
		  in cells correlate with tumorigenicity and angiogenesis in
		  nude mice (8, 9). HIF-1 is induced by the expression of
		  oncogenes such as v-Src and Ras (8, 10) and is
		  overexpressed in many human cancers (11). Loss of function
		  of HIF-1 results in defects in embryonic vascularization
		  (12, 13). HIF-1$\alpha$ expression, but not HIF-1$\beta$,
		  is induced by growth factors through the activation of PI3K
		  signaling (14, 15). HIF-1 activates the expression of VEGF
		  gene at the transcriptional level (16, 17). VEGF plays a
		  key role in tumor progression and angiogenesis (2, 3). Both
		  inhibition of VEGF expression and the function of its
		  receptor decrease dramatically the tumor growth, invasion,
		  and metastasis in animal models (18-26). Tissue hypoxia is
		  a major inducer for the expression of VEGF in tumors
		  (27,28). Somatic mutations such as oncogene Ras activation
		  and tumor suppressor gene p53 inactivation also increase
		  VEGF expression (10,29-31). Although HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF
		  are implicated in cancer development, the mechanisms of
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ activation and stabilization of HIF-1$\alpha$
		  protein remain to be studied. The present study
		  investigates Cr(VI)-induced expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and
		  VEGF in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells and the role
		  of individual reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cr(VI) is
		  chosen, because it is a well established carcinogen (32).
		  Cr(VI)-containing compounds are widely used in industry
		  under many occupational settings and are found in the
		  environment in the soil and water. Epidemiological studies
		  have shown that workers in the chromate production industry
		  have a consistently high risk for cancer than the general
		  population. Cr(VI) compounds are also potential inducers of
		  tumors in experimental animals (32). Although the
		  mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis are not
		  understood fully, ROS are considered to play an important
		  role (33-39). Previous studies have shown that upon
		  reduction by cellular oxidants, Cr(VI) is able to generate
		  a whole spectrum of ROS, i.e. O Formula , H2O2, and ⋅OH.
		  It is well known that ROS play important roles in
		  carcinogenesis induced by a variety of carcinogens. Through
		  ROS-mediated reaction, Cr(VI) is able to activate p53 and
		  induce apoptosis (37, 39, 40). It has been demonstrated
		  that HIF-1 interacts with p53 and is involved in tumor
		  progression (41-45). It is possible that Cr(VI) may be able
		  to induce the expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF. In the
		  present study, we tested whether Cr(VI) is able to induce
		  expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF. The specific
		  questions were as follows. (a) Is Cr(VI) able to induce
		  HIF-1 and VEGF expression? (b) What are the up-stream
		  signal pathways in Cr(VI)-induced expression of
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ protein? (c) Are ROS species involved in
		  Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression? (d) Which
		  species among ROS play the critical roles in Cr(VI)-induced
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression?},

		  was examined in human leukemia cells (U937 and Jurkat) in
		  relation to mitochondrial injury, oxidative damage, and
		  perturbations in signaling pathways. 2ME induced apoptosis
		  in these cells in a dose-dependent manner associated with
		  release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, AIF),
		  generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), downregulation
		  of Mcl-1 and XIAP, and inactivation (dephosphorylation) of
		  Akt accompanied by activation of JNK. In these cells,
		  enforced activation of Akt by a constitutively active
		  myristolated Akt construct prevented 2ME-mediated
		  mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, JNK
		  activation, and apoptosis, but not ROS generation.
		  Conversely, 2ME lethality was potentiated by the
		  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002.
		  Furthermore, in U937 cells, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger
		  catalase and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, TBAP,
		  blocked these events, as well as Akt inactivation.
		  Interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic or genetic
		  (e.g. siRNA) means attenuated 2ME-induced mitochondrial
		  injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, and apoptosis.
		  Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model
		  of 2ME-related apoptosis induction in human leukemia cells
		  in which 2ME-induced oxidative injury represents a primary
		  event resulting in Akt inactivation, leading, in turn, to
		  JNK activation, and culminating in XIAP and Mcl-1

		  also suggest that in human leukemia cells, the Akt pathway
		  plays a critical role in mediating the response to

		  active (i.e. not regulated). Herein we show to the contrary
		  that casein kinase 2 activity is rapidly and transiently
		  increased in response to Wnt3a stimulation and is essential
		  for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Chemical inhibition of
		  casein kinase 2 or suppression of its expression blocks
		  Frizzled-1 activation of Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene expression.
		  Treatment with pertussis toxin or knock down of Galpha(q)
		  or Galpha(o) blocks Wnt stimulation of casein kinase 2
		  activation, as does suppression of the phosphoprotein
		  Dishevelled, demonstrating that casein kinase 2 is
		  downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins and Dishevelled.
		  Expression of a constitutively active mutant of either
		  Galpha(q) or Galpha(o) stimulates casein kinase 2
		  activation and Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene expression. Thus,
		  casein kinase 2 is shown to be regulated by Wnt3a and
		  essential to stimulation of the
		  Frizzled-1/beta-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway.},

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: DKK1 is an antagonist of the Wnt signaling
		  pathway that has various roles in human physiology.
		  Notably, aberrant DKK1 expression is observed in several
		  cancers. In this retrospective study, we assessed the
		  association between DKK1 expression levels and head and
		  neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its prognostic
		  value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using RNA-seq data from HNSCC
		  tumors (N=520) and adjacent normal tissue (N=44) in The
		  Cancer Genome Atlas, we evaluated DKK1 expression levels.
		  Additionally, we evaluated the association of DKK1
		  expression levels and pathophysiological features of
		  patients with HNSCC and the value of DKK1 expression for
		  prediction of overall survival (OS). We also explored the
		  correlation between DKK1 expression and methylation of its
		  promoter in HNSCC. RESULTS: DKK1 expression was
		  significantly upregulated in HNSCC compared with normal
		  tissues. Moreover, DKK1 expression was significantly
		  associated with smoking, alcohol abuse, sex, human
		  papillomavirus status, tumor site, tumor invasion, and
		  pathologic stage in HNSCC patients. Kaplan-Meier curves
		  showed that high DKK1 expression was correlated with
		  inferior OS. In addition, univariate and multivariate
		  analyses showed that elevated DKK1 expression was an
		  independent prognostic factor for poor OS (HR: 1.85, 95{\%}
		  CI: 1.31-2.62, P{\textless}0.001). Regression analysis
		  identified a strong negative correlation between DKK1
		  expression and methylation of its promoter. CONCLUSION:
		  These findings support the hypothesis that elevated DKK1
		  expression is modulated via methylation of its promoter and
		  indicate that DKK1 expression is a highly informative
		  prognostic biomarker for patients with HNSCC.},

  abstract	= {Purpose: Pathological images are easily accessible data
		  with the potential as prognostic biomarkers. Moreover,
		  integration of heterogeneous data types from
		  multi-modality, such as pathological image and gene
		  expression data, is invaluable to help predicting cancer
		  patient survival. However, the analytical challenges are
		  significant. Experimental Design: Here we take the
		  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathological image features
		  extracted by CellProfiler, and apply them as the input for
		  Cox-nnet, a neural network-based prognosis. We compare this
		  model with conventional Cox-PH models, using C-index and
		  log ranked p-values on HCC testing samples. Further, to
		  integrate pathological image and gene expression data of
		  the same patients, we innovatively construct a two-stage
		  Cox-nnet model, and compare it with another complex neural
		  network model PAGE-Net. Results: pathological image based
		  prognosis prediction using Cox-nnet (median C-index 0.74
		  and log-rank p-value 4e-6) is significantly more accurate
		  than Cox-PH model (median C-index 0.72 and log-rank p-value
		  of 3e-4). Moreover, the two-stage Cox-nnet complex model
		  combining histopathology image and transcriptomics RNA-Seq
		  data achieves better prognosis prediction, with a median
		  C-index of 0.75 and log-rank p-value of 6e-7 in the testing
		  datasets. The results are much more accurate than PAGE-Net,
		  a CNN based complex model (median C-index of 0.67 and
		  log-rank p-value of 0.02). Imaging features present
		  additional predictive information to gene expression
		  features, as the combined model is much more accurate than
		  the model with gene expression alone (median C-index 0.70).
		  Pathological image features are modestly correlated with
		  gene expression. Genes having correlations to top imaging
		  features have known associations with HCC patient survival
		  and morphogenesis of liver tissue. Conclusion: This work
		  provides two-stage Cox-nnet, a new class of biologically
		  relevant and relatively interpretable models, to integrate

		  underdiagnosed subset of tumors, namely, the oncocytomas,
		  characterized by disruptive mutations of mtDNA, especially
		  of complex I subunits. Such mutations almost completely
		  abolish complex I activity, which slows down the Krebs
		  cycle, favoring a high ratio of
		  $\alpha$-ketoglutarate/succinate and consequent
		  destabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1$\alpha$
		  (HIF1$\alpha$). On the other hand, if complex I is
		  partially defective, the levels of NAD(+) may be sufficient
		  to implement the Krebs cycle with higher levels of
		  intermediates that stabilize HIF1$\alpha$, thus favoring
		  tumor malignancy. The threshold model we propose, based on
		  the population-like dynamics of mitochondrial genetics
		  (heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy), implies that below threshold
		  complex I is present and functioning correctly, thus
		  favoring tumor growth, whereas above threshold, when
		  complex I is not assembled, tumor growth is arrested. We

		  their contribution to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer
		  cells (glycolysis vs. respiration) is provided by an often
		  underdiagnosed subset of tumors, namely, the oncocytomas,
		  characterized by disruptive mutations of mtDNA, especially
		  of complex I subunits. Such mutations almost completely
		  abolish complex I activity, which slows down the Krebs
		  cycle, favoring a high ratio of
		  $\alpha$-ketoglutarate/succinate and consequent
		  destabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1$\alpha$
		  (HIF1$\alpha$). On the other hand, if complex I is
		  partially defective, the levels of NAD(+) may be sufficient
		  to implement the Krebs cycle with higher levels of
		  intermediates that stabilize HIF1$\alpha$, thus favoring
		  tumor malignancy. The threshold model we propose, based on
		  the population-like dynamics of mitochondrial genetics
		  (heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy), implies that below threshold
		  complex I is present and functioning correctly, thus
		  favoring tumor growth, whereas above threshold, when
		  complex I is not assembled, tumor growth is arrested. We
		  have therefore termed "oncojanus" the mtDNA genes whose
		  disruptive mutations have such a double-edged effect.},

  abstract	= {Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a
		  critical role in cardiac myocyte signaling in both healthy
		  and diseased cells. Mitochondria represent the predominant
		  cellular source of ROS, specifically the activity of
		  complexes I and III. The model presented here explores the
		  modulation of electron transport chain ROS production for
		  state 3 and state 4 respiration and the role of substrates
		  and respiratory inhibitors. Model simulations show that ROS
		  production from complex III increases exponentially with
		  membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$m) when in state 4.
		  Complex I ROS release in the model can occur in the
		  presence of NADH and succinate (reverse electron flow),
		  leading to a highly reduced ubiquinone pool, displaying the
		  highest ROS production flux in state 4. In the presence of
		  ample ROS scavenging, total ROS production is moderate in
		  state 3 and increases substantially under state 4
		  conditions. The ROS production model was extended by
		  combining it with a minimal model of ROS scavenging. When
		  the mitochondrial redox status was oxidized by increasing
		  the proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial
		  membrane, simulations with the combined model show that ROS
		  levels initially decline as production drops off with
		  decreasing $\Delta$$\Psi$m and then increase as scavenging
		  capacity is exhausted. Hence, this mechanistic model of ROS
		  production demonstrates how ROS levels are controlled by
		  mitochondrial redox balance.},

		  A, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib + cetuximab
		  was evaluated using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design; the
		  starting dose was afatinib 30 mg/day plus cetuximab 250

		  safety and tolerability at the MTD and preliminary
		  anti-tumour activity in three patient cohorts with squamous
		  non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other solid tumours.
		  Nine patients were treated in Part A; the MTD and
		  recommended dose was determined as afatinib 40 mg/day plus
		  cetuximab 250 mg/m2/week. In Part B, 49 patients were
		  treated at the recommended dose (12 with squamous NSCLC, 15
		  with HNSCC and 22 with other tumours). The most common
		  treatment-related adverse events (AEs) across all 58
		  patients were diarrhoea (63.8{\%}) and acneiform dermatitis
		  (43.1{\%}). Overall, the best confirmed response was stable
		  disease (SD; 53.4{\%}); mean duration of disease control

		  months. In Part B, 55.1{\%} of patients had SD (squamous
		  NSCLC, 75.0{\%}; HNSCC, 66.7{\%}; other tumours; 36.4{\%}).
		  In conclusion, the recommended phase 2 dose was determined
		  as afatinib 40 mg/day plus cetuximab 250 mg/m2/week. AEs

  abstract	= {Background: Tumors ferment glucose to lactate even in the
		  presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis; Warburg effect).
		  This nonoxidative conversion of glucose to lactate is
		  activated by transketolase, an enzyme of the pentose
		  phosphate pathway. For maintaining accelerated metabolism,
		  tumors are known to have high requirements for glucose and
		  thus have increased transport of glucose across the plasma
		  membrane. Metabolic dependence of tumors on glucose
		  utilization has been characterized by three genes; GLUT1,
		  GLUT 4 and TKTL1/2. However, the expression patterns of the
		  genes have not been explored fully for early stages of
		  colorectal carcinogenesis. In this study we studied the
		  expression pattern of these genes in colonic carcinogenesis
		  (rat-AOM model and human CRC) and chemoprevention (by
		  studying the effect of celecoxib in, Caco-2 and HCT-116
		  cell lines). Methods: Immunohistochemical expression of
		  GLUT1, GLUT4, and TKTL1/2 was analyzed in human colon caner
		  tissue array (consisting of 36 cases of colonic cancers and
		  12 cases each of normal, inflammatory and benign tumor
		  tissues of the colon). In addition we analyzed 14 week
		  AOM-treated rat colon tissue samples (early stage of
		  colorectal carcinogenesis model) and saline-treated
		  samples. Caco-2 and HCT-116 CRC cells were treated with
		  50muM celecoxib for 72hrs. Further analysis was carried out
		  through real-time PCR using TKTL (1 {\&} 2), GLUT (1
		  {\&}4), PCNA and beta-actin (control) Taqman probes.
		  Results: Our results reveal an increased expression of
		  GLUT1, GLUT4 and TKTL1/2 during CRC progression from
		  adenoma to mucinous adenocarcinoma (Table 1). Increased
		  expression of these genes was evident during early onset of
		  carcinogenesis as shown in 14 week AOM-treated rat colon.
		  Lastly, the cell culture data revealed that celecoxib
		  caused a significant reduction in the expression of these
		  metabolic markers in Caco-2 (p{\textless}.01) or HCT-116
		  (p{\textless}.05). These changes corresponded to the
		  reduction in the proliferation marker PCNA in Caco-2
		  (95{\%}) or in HCT-116 cells (39{\%}) (Table 2).
		  Conclusions: We, herein, demonstrate that expression of
		  GLUT 1, GLUT4, and TKTL1/2 is significantly altered during
		  early CRC and are key factors in cancer progression. Our
		  studies show a significant increase in the glucose
		  transporter 1 and 4, in relationship to cancer progression
		  and early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, thereby
		  proposing potential biomarker role for these markers.
		  TKTL1/2, on the other hand, seems to be up regulated in
		  only a few of human colorectal tumors, which portends it to
		  be a subset-specific biomarker. We further demonstrate that
		  chemopreventive properties of celecoxib against colorectal
		  cancer (Caco-2 and HCT-116 cells) may be modulated by the
		  metabolic mediators involved in glycolysis. Further studies
		  are needed to access the clinical application of these
		  receptors as potential biomarkers for colorectal cancer.

		  STUDY DESIGN: Oral epithelial cells from a 30-week
		  gestational, stillborn male fetus were grown in serum-free
		  medium and transfected by lipid-mediation with the shuttle
		  vector plasmid, pZ189, containing the T-antigen coding

		  RESULTS: Resulting cultures produced foci of rapidly

		  polyclonal. The original culture possessed a normal human
		  male karyotype, and the transformed line was largely

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lactate was previously shown to be
		  a prognostic but not a predictive pre-therapeutic marker
		  for radiation response of tumor xenografts. We hypothesize
		  that metabolic changes during fractionated irradiation may
		  restrict the predictiveness of lactate regarding tumor
		  radiosensitivity.
		  
		  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor xenografts were generated in
		  nude mice by implanting 4 head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma lines with different sensitivities to
		  fractionated irradiation. Tumors were irradiated with up to
		  15 fractions of 2 Gy over a period of 3 weeks, and ATP
		  and lactate levels were measured in vital tumor areas with
		  induced metabolic bioluminescence imaging. Corresponding
		  changes in mRNA expression of glycolysis-related genes were
		  determined by quantitative RT-PCR.
		  
		  RESULTS: Lactate content decreased significantly in 3 out
		  of 4 cell lines in the course of irradiation showing no
		  correlation with cell line-specific radiosensitivity.
		  Radiation-induced changes in ATP levels and
		  glycolysis-related mRNA expression, however, only occurred
		  in radiosensitive or intermediately radioresistant
		  xenografts, whereas these parameters remained unchanged in
		  radioresistant tumors.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Sensitivity-related differences in the
		  transcriptional response of tumors to radiotherapy may be
		  exploited in the clinic for better individualization of
		  tumor treatment.},

  abstract	= {Current thought is that proliferating cells undergo a
		  shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, where the
		  energy requirements of the rapidly dividing cell are
		  provided by ATP from glycolysis. Drawing on the
		  hexokinase-mitochondrial acceptor theory of insulin action,
		  this article presents evidence suggesting that the
		  increased binding of hexokinase to porin on mitochondria of
		  cancer cells not only accelerates glycolysis by providing
		  hexokinase with better access to ATP, but also stimulates
		  the TCA cycle by providing the mitochondrion with ADP that
		  acts as an acceptor for phosphoryl groups. Furthermore,
		  this acceleration of the TCA cycle stimulates protein
		  synthesis via two mechanisms: first, by increasing ATP
		  production, and second, by provision of certain amino acids
		  required for protein synthesis, since the amino acids
		  glutamate, alanine, and aspartate are either reduction
		  products or partially oxidized products of the
		  intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. The
		  utilization of oxygen in the course of the TCA cycle
		  turnover is relatively diminished even though TCA cycle
		  intermediates are being consumed. With partial oxidation of
		  TCA cycle intermediates into amino acids, there is
		  necessarily a reduction in formation of CO2 from pyruvate,
		  seen as a relative diminution in utilization of oxygen in
		  relation to carbon utilization. This has been assumed to be
		  an inhibition of oxygen uptake and therefore a diminution
		  of TCA cycle activity. Therefore a switch from oxidative
		  metabolism to glycolytic metabolism has been assumed (the
		  Crabtree effect). By stimulating both ATP production and
		  protein synthesis for the rapidly dividing cell, the
		  binding of hexokinase to mitochondrial porin lies at the
		  core of proliferative energy metabolism. This article
		  further reviews literature on the binding of the isozymes
		  of hexokinase to porin, and on the evolution of insulin,

		  products derived from Brassica vegetables, is a promising
		  antitumor agent. Previous studies in our laboratory showed
		  that 3,3′-diindolylmethane induced a G1 cell cycle arrest
		  in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by a mechanism that
		  included increased expression of p21. In the present study,
		  the upstream events leading to p21 overexpression were
		  further investigated. We show for the first time that
		  3,3′-diindolylmethane is a strong mitochondrial H+-ATPase
		  inhibitor (IC50∼20 $\mu$mol/L). 3,3′-Diindolylmethane
		  treatment induced hyperpolarization of mitochondrial inner
		  membrane, decreased cellular ATP level, and significantly
		  stimulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
		  production. ROS production, in turn, led to the activation
		  of stress-activated pathways involving p38 and c-Jun
		  NH2-terminal kinase. Using specific kinase inhibitors
		  (SB203580 and SP600125), we showed the central role of p38
		  and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways in
		  3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced p21 mRNA transcription. In
		  addition, antioxidants significantly attenuated
		  3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced activation of p38 and JNK
		  and induction of p21, indicating that oxidative stress is
		  the major trigger of these events. To further support the
		  role of ROS in 3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced p21
		  overexpression, we showed that 3,3′-diindolylmethane
		  failed to induce p21 overexpression in mitochondrial
		  respiratory chain deficient $\rho$0 MCF-7 cells, in which
		  3,3′-diindolylmethane did not stimulate ROS production.
		  Thus, we have established the critical role of enhanced

		  recurrence in patients treated for head and neck squamous
		  cell carcinoma is, at present, the extent of regional lymph
		  node metastasis. Since elevated levels of epidermal growth
		  factor receptor (EGFR) and of its ligand, transforming
		  growth factor-$\alpha$ (TGF-$\alpha$), have been detected
		  in primary tumors of patients with head and neck squamous
		  cell carcinoma, we determined whether tumor levels of these
		  proteins were of prognostic importance. Methods: Monoclonal
		  antibodies specific for EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ were used for
		  immunohistochemical detection of each protein in tissue
		  sections of primary tumors from 91 patients who were
		  treated by surgical resection. Levels of immunoreactive
		  EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ were quantified by use of a
		  computerized image analysis system and were normalized to
		  appropriate standards. The logrank test and proportional
		  hazards regression analysis were used to calculate the
		  probability that EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ levels were
		  associated with disease-free survival (i.e., no recurrence
		  of cancer) and cause-specific survival (i.e., patients do
		  not die of their disease). All P values were two-sided.
		  Results: When tumor levels of EGFR or TGF-$\alpha$ were
		  analyzed as continuous variables, disease-free survival and
		  cause-specific survival were reduced among patients with
		  higher levels of EGFR (both P = .0001) or TGF-$\alpha$
		  (both P = .0001). In a multivariate analysis, tumor site,
		  tumor level of EGFR, and tumor level of TGF-$\alpha$ were
		  statistically significant predictors of disease-free
		  survival; in a similar analysis, regional lymph node stage
		  and tumor levels of EGFR and of TGF-$\alpha$ were
		  significant predictors of cause-specific survival.
		  Conclusion: Quantitation of EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ protein
		  levels in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: When designing an epigenome-wide association
		  study (EWAS) to investigate the relationship between DNA
		  methylation (DNAm) and some exposure(s) or phenotype(s), it
		  is critically important to assess the sample size needed to
		  detect a hypothesized difference with adequate statistical
		  power. However, the complex and nuanced nature of DNAm data
		  makes direct assessment of statistical power challenging.
		  To circumvent these challenges and to address the
		  outstanding need for a user-friendly interface for EWAS
		  power evaluation, we have developed pwrEWAS. RESULTS: The
		  current implementation of pwrEWAS accommodates power
		  estimation for two-group comparisons of DNAm (e.g. case vs
		  control, exposed vs non-exposed, etc.), where methylation
		  assessment is carried out using the Illumina Human
		  Methylation BeadChip technology. Power is calculated using
		  a semi-parametric simulation-based approach in which DNAm
		  data is randomly generated from beta-distributions using
		  CpG-specific means and variances estimated from one of
		  several different existing DNAm data sets, chosen to cover
		  the most common tissue-types used in EWAS. In addition to
		  specifying the tissue type to be used for DNAm profiling,
		  users are required to specify the sample size, number of
		  differentially methylated CpGs, effect size(s) (Deltabeta),
		  target false discovery rate (FDR) and the number of
		  simulated data sets, and have the option of selecting from
		  several different statistical methods to perform
		  differential methylation analyses. pwrEWAS reports the
		  marginal power, marginal type I error rate, marginal FDR,
		  and false discovery cost (FDC). Here, we demonstrate how
		  pwrEWAS can be applied in practice using a hypothetical
		  EWAS. In addition, we report its computational efficiency
		  across a variety of user settings. CONCLUSION: Both under-
		  and overpowered studies unnecessarily deplete resources and
		  even risk failure of a study. With pwrEWAS, we provide a
		  user-friendly tool to help researchers circumvent these
		  risks and to assist in the design and planning of EWAS.

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: An estimated 4{\%} to 7{\%} of the population
		  will develop a clinically significant thyroid nodule during
		  their lifetime. In many cases, preoperative diagnoses by
		  needle biopsy are inconclusive. Thus, there is a clear need
		  for improved diagnostic tests to distinguish malignant from
		  benign thyroid tumors. The recent development of
		  high-throughput molecular analytic techniques should allow
		  the rapid evaluation of new diagnostic markers. However,
		  researchers are faced with an overwhelming number of
		  potential markers from numerous thyroid cancer expression
		  profiling studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this
		  challenge, we have carried out a comprehensive meta-review
		  of thyroid cancer biomarkers from 21 published studies. A
		  gene ranking system that considers the number of
		  comparisons in agreement, total number of samples, average
		  fold-change and direction of change was devised. RESULTS:
		  We have observed that genes are consistently reported by
		  multiple studies at a highly significant rate (P
		  {\textless} .05). Comparison with a meta-analysis of
		  studies reprocessed from raw data showed strong concordance
		  with our method. CONCLUSION: Our approach represents a
		  useful method for identifying consistent gene expression
		  markers when raw data are unavailable. A review of the top
		  12 candidates revealed well known thyroid cancer markers
		  such as MET, TFF3, SERPINA1, TIMP1, FN1, and TPO as well as
		  relatively novel or uncharacterized genes such as TGFA,
		  QPCT, CRABP1, FCGBP, EPS8 and PROS1. These candidates
		  should help to develop a panel of markers with sufficient

		  positive self-regard scale (UPSR) and its two subscales
		  developed by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). It also aims to
		  examine and compare the concepts of UPSR with
		  self-compassion and its relation to mental well-being.
		  Design: Correlation survey design validations of the UPSR
		  scale (Patterson {\&} Joseph, 2006). Methods: The
		  validation was conducted using an undergraduate and
		  postgraduate student opportunity sample, n = 179. Internal
		  consistency was assessed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha
		  and inter-item correlations. Convergent and divergent
		  validity was explored in terms of correlations with
		  self-compassion, depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7)
		  scales. Results: There was good internal consistency for
		  both the UPSR scale and the self-regard subscale and
		  somewhat questionable internal consistency for the
		  conditionality subscale. Overall the scale appears to be
		  relatively consistent, supporting the previous findings
		  reported by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). The results
		  supported the hypothesis that UPSR is positively correlated
		  with a measure of self-compassion and negatively correlated
		  with measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7).
		  Conclusions: The UPSR scale is a valid measure of the
		  person-centred concept of unconditional positive
		  self-regard. This supports the potential use of the UPSR
		  scale for evaluating therapeutic change for client-centred
		  practitioners through the use of this non-medicalized tool.},

  abstract	= {Objectives: The purpose of this study is to test the
		  psychometric properties and validity of the unconditional
		  positive self-regard scale (UPSR) and its two subscales
		  developed by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). It also aims to
		  examine and compare the concepts of UPSR with
		  self-compassion and its relation to mental well-being.
		  Design: Correlation survey design validations of the UPSR
		  scale (Patterson {\&} Joseph, 2006). Methods: The
		  validation was conducted using an undergraduate and
		  postgraduate student opportunity sample, n = 179. Internal
		  consistency was assessed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha
		  and inter-item correlations. Convergent and divergent
		  validity was explored in terms of correlations with
		  self-compassion, depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7)
		  scales. Results: There was good internal consistency for
		  both the UPSR scale and the self-regard subscale and
		  somewhat questionable internal consistency for the
		  conditionality subscale. Overall the scale appears to be
		  relatively consistent, supporting the previous findings
		  reported by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). The results
		  supported the hypothesis that UPSR is positively correlated
		  with a measure of self-compassion and negatively correlated
		  with measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7).
		  Conclusions: The UPSR scale is a valid measure of the
		  person-centred concept of unconditional positive
		  self-regard. This supports the potential use of the UPSR
		  scale for evaluating therapeutic change for client-centred
		  practitioners through the use of this non-medicalized tool.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Biomarkers allowing the characterization of
		  malignancy and therapy response of oral squamous cell
		  carcinomas (OSCC) or other types of carcinomas are still
		  outstanding. The biochemical suicide molecule endonuclease
		  DNaseX (DNaseI-like 1) has been used to identify the Apo10
		  protein epitope that marks tumor cells with abnormal
		  apoptosis and proliferation. The transketolase-like protein
		  1 (TKTL1) represents the enzymatic basis for an anaerobic
		  glucose metabolism even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic
		  glycolysis/Warburg effect), which is concomitant with a
		  more malignant phenotype due to invasive growth/metastasis
		  and resistance to radical and apoptosis inducing therapies.
		  
		  METHODS: Expression of Apo10 and TKTL1 was analysed
		  retrospectively in OSCC specimen (n = 161) by
		  immunohistochemistry. Both markers represent independent
		  markers for poor survival. Furthermore Apo10 and TKTL1 have
		  been used prospectively for epitope detection in monocytes
		  (EDIM)-blood test in patients with OSCC (n = 50),
		  breast cancer (n = 48), prostate cancer (n = 115),
		  and blood donors/controls (n = 74).
		  
		  RESULTS: Positive Apo10 and TKTL1 expression were
		  associated with recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate
		  analysis demonstrated Apo10 and TKTL1 expression as an
		  independent prognostic factor for reduced tumor-specific
		  survival. Apo10+/TKTL1+ subgroup showed the worst
		  disease-free survival rate in OSCC.EDIM-Apo10 and
		  EDIM-TKTL1 blood tests allowed a sensitive and specific
		  detection of patients with OSCC, breast cancer and prostate
		  cancer before surgery and in after care. A combined score
		  of Apo10+/TKTL1+ led to a sensitivity of 95.8{\%} and a
		  specificity of 97.3{\%} for the detection of carcinomas
		  independent of the tumor entity.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: The combined detection of two independent
		  fundamental biophysical processes by the two biomarkers
		  Apo10 and TKTL1 allows a sensitive and specific detection
		  of neoplasia in a noninvasive and cost-effective way.
		  Further prospective trials are warranted to validate this
		  new concept for the diagnosis of neoplasia and tumor

		  carcinogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
		  
		  METHODS: Expression of IGF-R1, glycolysis-related proteins
		  (GLUT-1, HK 2, PFK-1, LDHA, TKTL1), mitochondrial enzymes
		  (SDHA, SDHB, ATP synthase) were analyzed in normal oral
		  mucosa (n = 5), oral precursor lesions (simple
		  hyperplasia, n = 11; squamous intraepithelial
		  neoplasia, SIN I-III, n = 35), and OSCC specimen
		  (n = 42) by immunohistochemistry and real-time
		  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis in OSCC cell
		  lines. Metabolism-related proteins were correlated with
		  proliferation activity (Ki-67) and apoptotic properties
		  (TUNEL assay) in OSCC. Specificity of antibodies was
		  confirmed by western blotting in cancer cell lines.
		  
		  RESULTS: Expression of IGF-R1, glycolysis-related proteins
		  (GLUT-1, HK 2, LDHA, TKTL1), and mitochondrial enzymes
		  (SDHA, SDHB, ATP synthase) were significantly increased in
		  the carcinogenesis of OSCC. Metabolic active regions of
		  OSCC were strongly correlated with proliferating cancer
		  (Ki-67+) cells without detection of apoptosis (TUNEL
		  assay).
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the
		  expression of IGF-R1, glycolysis-related proteins GLUT-1,
		  HK 2, PFK-1, LDHA, and TKTL1, as well as mitochondrial
		  enzymes SDHA, SDHB, and ATP synthase in the multi-step
		  carcinogenesis of OSCC. Both, hypoxia-related glucose
		  metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
		  characteristics are associated with the carcinogenesis of
		  OSCC. Acidosis and OXPHOS may drive a metabolic shift
		  towards the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Therefore,
		  inhibition of the PPP, glycolysis, and targeted
		  anti-mitochondrial therapies (ROS generation) by natural
		  compounds or synthetic vitamin derivatives may act as
		  sensitizer for apoptosis in cancer cells mediated by
		  adjuvant therapies in OSCC.},

		  task we used the novel technique of matrix-assisted laser
		  desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry
		  (IMS) on genetically engineered mouse models (GEM) of
		  pancreatic cancer. Various GEM were analyzed with MALDI IMS
		  to investigate the peptide/protein-expression pattern of

		  several discriminative m/z-species between normal and

		  distinguished from normal pancreatic tissue and PDAC by 26
		  significant m/z-species. Among these m/z-species, we
		  identified Albumin and Thymosin-beta 4 by liquid
		  chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS),
		  which were further validated by immunohistochemistry,
		  western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA in both murine

  abstract	= {Mitochondria play a central role not only in energy
		  production but also in the integration of metabolic
		  pathways as well as signals for apoptosis and autophagy. It
		  is becoming increasingly apparent that mitochondria in
		  mammalian cells play critical roles in the initiation and
		  propagation of various signaling cascades. In particular,
		  mitochondrial metabolic and respiratory states and status
		  on mitochondrial genetic instability are communicated to
		  the nucleus as an adaptive response through retrograde
		  signaling. Each mammalian cell contains multiple copies of
		  the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). A reduction in mtDNA copy
		  number has been reported in various human pathological
		  conditions such as diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative
		  disorders, aging and cancer. Reduction in mtDNA copy number
		  disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential ($\Delta$$\psi$m)
		  resulting in dysfunctional mitochondria. Dysfunctional
		  mitochondria trigger retrograde signaling and communicate
		  their changing metabolic and functional state to the
		  nucleus as an adaptive response resulting in an altered
		  nuclear gene expression profile and altered cell physiology
		  and morphology. In this review, we provide an overview of
		  the various modes of mitochondrial retrograde signaling
		  focusing particularly on the Ca(2+)/Calcineurin mediated
		  retrograde signaling. We discuss the contribution of the

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE Although the literature suggests that a positive
		  tumour margin on permanent section portends a poor
		  oncologic outcome, the prognostic implication of
		  microscopic tumour cut-through (ie, positive tumour margin
		  on intraoperative frozen section) that is surgically
		  revised to a negative final margin on permanent section is
		  currently unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze
		  the influence of microscopic tumour cut-through on disease
		  recurrence and survival and to establish clinicopathologic
		  variables associated with tumour cut-through. DESIGN A
		  retrospective chart review. SETTING The Odette Cancer
		  Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto. METHODS
		  Comprehensive clinicopathologic data were collected,
		  including demography, clinical tumour staging (TNM),
		  treatment, histopathologic details, recurrence, management,
		  and follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Local cancer control
		  and disease-specific survival were the main outcome
		  measures of interest. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
		  assess outcome measures by patient group, and the log-rank
		  test was used to compare survival curves. Univariate and
		  multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses
		  were used to test the association of various clinical
		  factors and to identify independent prognostic factors of
		  local control and disease-specific survival. RESULTS
		  Sixty-five patients met inclusion criteria for our study
		  (37 males; median age 64.4 years). Both local control and
		  disease-specific survival were statistically significantly
		  reduced in patients with positive intraoperative frozen
		  section despite revision to obtain negative margins (p
		  {\textless} .05). Multivariate analysis showed that
		  microscopic tumour cut-through independently predicted
		  poorer local control and disease-specific survival (p
		  {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS This study in patients
		  receiving primary surgery for oral squamous cell carcinoma
		  shows that microscopic tumour cut-through on intraoperative
		  frozen section independently portends a poorer oncologic
		  prognosis, regardless of ultimate tumour margin pathology.},
  annote	= {retrospective study
		  
		  Guillemaud and colleagues conducted a retrospective chart
		  review of 65 patients and found that both local control and
		  disease-specific survival were significantly reduced in
		  patients who had initial positive frozen sections despite
		  revision to negative.
		  
		  In situations where an intraoperative positive margin is
		  obtained, even if the margins are revised to negative by
		  the completion of the surgery, additional therapy should be
		  considered based on the propensity for local recurrence and
		  decreased overall survival of these patients, as
		  demonstrated in the present study
		  
		  They also found that microscopic tumor cut-through on
		  intraoperative frozen sections independently predicted
		  poorer local control and disease-specific survival,

		  histologically altered epithelium surrounding tumor samples
		  taken from the upper aerodigestive tract. Since then, the
		  term has been used to describe multiple patches of
		  pre-malignant disease, a higher-than-expected prevalence of
		  multiple local second primary tumors, and the presence of
		  synchronous distant tumors within the upper aerodigestive
		  tract. Molecular techniques such as karyotype analysis,
		  microsatellite analysis, p53 mutation screening, and
		  X-chromosome inactivation studies have further refined the
		  relationship among these lesions. While there are
		  differences in the techniques used to identify the clonal
		  origins of the lesions, these studies indicate that there
		  is often lateral clonal spread of pre-malignant or
		  malignant disease, and a significant portion of local
		  second primary tumors are in fact genetically related.
		  Distant second primary tumors found in the esophagus are
		  often not related to concurrent head and neck cancer,
		  whereas synchronous squamous lung tumors with a head and
		  neck primary are often, in fact, metastases, rather than
		  independently arising malignancies. These observations help
		  to explain the high incidence of recurrent disease, despite
		  excision or other therapy?pre-malignant or malignant clones
		  often have the ability to migrate and persist outside of
		  the field of treatment. Therefore, alternative means of
		  prevention or therapy that can affect the entire head and
		  neck region may be of benefit to such patients. Future
		  studies will further refine the relationship among these
		  lesions and perhaps identify key molecular alterations to
		  be used as targets for gene therapy.},

  abstract	= {Insulin regulates glucose uptake through effects on the
		  trafficking of the glucose transporter Glut4. To
		  investigate the degree of overlap between Glut4 and the
		  general endocytic pathways, the kinetics of trafficking of
		  Glut4 and the receptors for transferrin (Tf) and
		  $\alpha$(2)-macroglobulin ($\alpha$-2-M; LRP-1) were
		  compared using quantitative flow cytometric assays. Insulin
		  increased the exocytic rate constant (k(ex)) for both Glut4
		  and Tf. However, the k(ex) of Glut4 was 5-15 times slower
		  than Tf in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. The
		  endocytic rate constant (k(en)) of Glut4 was also five
		  times slower than Tf. Insulin did not affect the k(en) of
		  either protein. In basal cells, the k(en) for
		  $\alpha$-2-M/LRP-1 was similar to Glut4 but 5-fold slower
		  than Tf. Insulin increased k(en) for $\alpha$-2-M/LRP-1 by
		  30{\%}. In contrast, the k(ex) for LRP-1 was five times
		  faster than Glut4 in basal cells, and insulin did not
		  increase this rate constant. Thus, although there is
		  overlap in the protein machineries/compartments utilized,
		  the differences in trafficking kinetics indicate that
		  Glut4, the Tf receptor, and LRP-1 are differentially
		  processed both within the cell and at the plasma membrane.
		  It has been reported that insulin decreases the k(en) of
		  Glut4 in adipocytes. However, the effect of exocytosis on
		  the "internalization" assays was not considered. Because it
		  is counterintuitive, the effect of exocytosis on these
		  assays is often overlooked in endocytosis studies. Using
		  mathematical modeling and simulation, we show that the
		  reported decrease in Glut4 k(en) can be entirely accounted
		  for by the well established increase in Glut4 k(ex).},

		  We performed a hypothesis‐driven association study
		  between clinical features in adrenocortical carcinomas and
		  the expression levels of 136 genes involved in DNA
		  metabolism and G1/S phase transition. In 79 samples
		  downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas portal, high Cyclin
		  Dependent Kinase 6 (CDK6) mRNA levels gave the most
		  significant association with shorter time to relapse and
		  poorer survival of patients. A hierarchical clustering
		  approach assembled most tumors with high levels of CDK6
		  mRNA into one group. These tumors tend to cumulate
		  mutations activating the Wnt/$\beta$‐catenin pathway and
		  show reduced MIR506 expression. Actually, the level of
		  MIR506 RNA is inversely correlated with the levels of both
		  CDK6 and CTNNB1 (encoding $\beta$‐catenin). Together
		  these results indicate that high CDK6 expression is found
		  in aggressive tumors with activated Wnt/$\beta$‐catenin
		  pathway. Thus we tested the impact of Food and Drug
		  Administration‐approved CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, namely
		  palbociclib and ribociclib, on SW‐13 and NCI‐H295R
		  cells. While both drugs reduced viability and induced
		  senescence in SW‐13 cells, only palbociclib was effective
		  on the retinoblastoma protein (pRB)‐negative NCI‐H295R
		  cells, by inducing apoptosis. In NCI‐H295R cells,
		  palbociclib induced an increase of the active form of
		  Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3$\beta$ (GSK3$\beta$) responsible
		  for the reduced amount of active $\beta$‐catenin, and
		  altered the amount of AXIN2 mRNA. Taken together, these
		  data underline the impact of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors in
		  treating adrenocortical carcinomas.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Efficacy of withaferin A (WA), an Ayurvedic
		  medicine constituent, for prevention of mammary cancer and
		  its associated mechanisms were investigated using mouse
		  mammary tumor virus-neu (MMTV-neu) transgenic model.
		  
		  METHODS: Incidence and burden of mammary cancer and
		  pulmonary metastasis were scored in female MMTV-neu mice
		  after 28 weeks of intraperitoneal administration with 100
		  µg WA (three times/week) (n = 32) or vehicle (n = 29).
		  Mechanisms underlying mammary cancer prevention by WA were
		  investigated by determination of tumor cell proliferation,
		  apoptosis, metabolomics, and proteomics using plasma and/or
		  tumor tissues. Spectrophotometric assays were performed to
		  determine activities of complex III and complex IV. All
		  statistical tests were two-sided.
		  
		  RESULTS: WA administration resulted in a statistically
		  significant decrease in macroscopic mammary tumor size,
		  microscopic mammary tumor area, and the incidence of
		  pulmonary metastasis. For example, the mean area of
		  invasive cancer was lower by 95.14{\%} in the WA treatment
		  group compared with the control group (mean = 3.10 vs 63.77
		  mm2, respectively; difference = -60.67 mm2; 95{\%}
		  confidence interval = -122.50 to 1.13 mm2; P = .0536).
		  Mammary cancer prevention by WA treatment was associated
		  with increased apoptosis, inhibition of complex III
		  activity, and reduced levels of glycolysis intermediates.
		  Proteomics confirmed downregulation of many
		  glycolysis-related proteins in the tumor of WA-treated mice
		  compared with control, including M2-type pyruvate kinase,
		  phospho glycerate kinase, and fructose-bisphosphate
		  aldolase A isoform 2.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals suppression of glycolysis
		  in WA-mediated mammary cancer prevention in a clinically
		  relevant mouse model.},

		  which modulated ROS production and the subsequent synthesis
		  of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte
		  chemoattractant protein-1. Pull-down assays showed that the
		  Ras family small G protein, Rap1 was activated by CB2.
		  Dominant-negative Rap1 profoundly enhanced CB1-dependent
		  ROS production by macrophages, suggesting CB2
		  Rap1-dependently inhibits CB1-stimulated ROS production.
		  CONCLUSION: CB1 promotes pro-inflammatory responses of
		  macrophages through ROS production, which is negatively
		  regulated by CB2 through Rap1 activation. Blocking CB1
		  together with selective activation of CB2 may suppress
		  pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages.},

		  membranes and mitochondria have been densely annotated, and
		  propose a two-stage procedure that produces realistic
		  images using Generative Adversarial Networks (or GANs) in a

		  supervision for EM image synthesis in the second stage. The
		  full model naturally generates label-image pairs. We show
		  that accurate synthetic EM images are produced using
		  assessment via (1) shape features and global statistics,
		  (2) segmentation accuracies, and (3) user studies. We also
		  demonstrate further improvements by enforcing a

  abstract	= {Overview An enigma for cancer medicine lies in its
		  complexity and variability, at all levels of consideration.
		  The hallmarks of cancer constitute an organizing principle
		  that provides a conceptual basis for distilling the
		  complexity of this disease in order to better understand it
		  in its diverse presentations. This conceptualization
		  involves eight biological capabilities?the hallmarks of
		  cancer?acquired by cancer cells during the long process of
		  tumor development and malignant progression. Two
		  characteristic traits of cancer cells facilitate the
		  acquisition of these functional capabilities. The eight
		  distinct hallmarks consist of sustaining proliferative
		  signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell
		  death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
		  angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis,
		  deregulating cellular energetics and metabolism, and
		  avoiding immune destruction. The principal facilitators of
		  their acquisition are genome instability with consequent
		  gene mutation and tumor-promoting inflammation. The
		  integration of these hallmark capabilities involves
		  heterotypic interactions among multiple cell types
		  populating the ?tumor microenvironment? (TME), which is
		  composed of cancer cells and a tumor-associated stroma,
		  including three prominent classes of recruited support
		  cells?angiogenic vascular cells (AVC), various subtypes of
		  fibroblasts, and infiltrating immune cells (IIC). In
		  addition, the neoplastic cells populating individual tumors
		  are themselves typically heterogeneous, in that cancer
		  cells can assume a variety of distinctive phenotypic states
		  and undergo genetic diversification during tumor
		  progression. Accordingly, the hallmarks of cancer?this set
		  of necessarily acquired capabilities and their
		  facilitators?constitute a useful heuristic tool for
		  elucidating mechanistic bases and commonalties underlying
		  the pathogenesis of diverse forms of human cancer, with
		  potential applications to cancer therapy.},

		  ({\textgreater} or = 4 mm) primary cutaneous melanoma
		  and/or locoregional metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In
		  this randomized controlled trial involving 674 patients,
		  the effect of interferon alfa-2a (3 megaunits three times
		  per week for 2 years or until recurrence) on overall
		  survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was
		  compared with that of no further treatment in radically
		  resected stage IIB and stage III cutaneous malignant
		  melanoma. RESULTS: The OS and RFS rates at 5 years were
		  44{\%} (SE, 2.6) and 32{\%} (SE, 2.1), respectively. There
		  was no significant difference in OS or RFS between the
		  interferon-treated and control arms (odds ratio [OR], 0.94;
		  95{\%} CI, 0.75 to 1.18; P =.6; and OR, 0.91; 95{\%} CI,
		  0.75 to 1.10; P =.3; respectively). Male sex (P =.003) and
		  regional lymph node involvement (P =.0009), but not age (P

		  OS. Subgroup analysis by disease stage, age, and sex did
		  not show any clear differences between interferon-treated
		  and control groups in either OS or RFS. Interferon-related
		  toxicities were modest: grade 3 (and in only one case,
		  grade 4) fatigue or mood disturbance was seen in 7{\%} and
		  4{\%} respectively, of patients. However, there were 50
		  withdrawals (15{\%}) from interferon treatment due to
		  toxicity. CONCLUSION: The results from this study, taken in

		  peptides with diverse functions. Polypeptide beta(1) is
		  identical to ubiquitin truncated by two C-terminal glycine
		  residues. Several peptides related to thymosin beta(4) were

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Understanding the complex biological
		  mechanisms of cancer patient survival using genomic and
		  clinical data is vital, not only to develop new treatments
		  for patients, but also to improve survival prediction.
		  However, highly nonlinear and high-dimension, low-sample
		  size (HDLSS) data cause computational challenges to
		  applying conventional survival analysis. RESULTS: We
		  propose a novel biologically interpretable pathway-based
		  sparse deep neural network, named Cox-PASNet, which
		  integrates high-dimensional gene expression data and
		  clinical data on a simple neural network architecture for
		  survival analysis. Cox-PASNet is biologically interpretable
		  where nodes in the neural network correspond to biological
		  genes and pathways, while capturing the nonlinear and
		  hierarchical effects of biological pathways associated with
		  cancer patient survival. We also propose a heuristic
		  optimization solution to train Cox-PASNet with HDLSS data.
		  Cox-PASNet was intensively evaluated by comparing the
		  predictive performance of current state-of-the-art methods
		  on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and ovarian serous
		  cystadenocarcinoma (OV) cancer. In the experiments,
		  Cox-PASNet showed out-performance, compared to the
		  benchmarking methods. Moreover, the neural network
		  architecture of Cox-PASNet was biologically interpreted,
		  and several significant prognostic factors of genes and
		  biological pathways were identified. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Cox-PASNet models biological mechanisms in the neural
		  network by incorporating biological pathway databases and
		  sparse coding. The neural network of Cox-PASNet can
		  identify nonlinear and hierarchical associations of genomic
		  and clinical data to cancer patient survival. The

  abstract	= {The integration of multi-modal data, such as
		  histopathological images and genomic data, is essential for
		  understanding cancer heterogeneity and complexity for
		  personalized treatments, as well as for enhancing survival
		  predictions in cancer study. Histopathology, as a clinical
		  gold-standard tool for diagnosis and prognosis in cancers,
		  allows clinicians to make precise decisions on therapies,
		  whereas high-throughput genomic data have been investigated
		  to dissect the genetic mechanisms of cancers. We propose a
		  biologically interpretable deep learning model (PAGE-Net)
		  that integrates histopathological images and genomic data,
		  not only to improve survival prediction, but also to
		  identify genetic and histopathological patterns that cause
		  different survival rates in patients. PAGE-Net consists of
		  pathology/genome/demography-specific layers, each of which
		  provides comprehensive biological interpretation. In
		  particular, we propose a novel patch-wise texture-based
		  convolutional neural network, with a patch aggregation
		  strategy, to extract global survival-discriminative
		  features, without manual annotation for the
		  pathology-specific layers. We adapted the pathway-based
		  sparse deep neural network, named Cox-PASNet, for the
		  genome-specific layers. The proposed deep learning model
		  was assessed with the histopathological images and the gene
		  expression data of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) at The
		  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Imaging Archive
		  (TCIA). PAGE-Net achieved a C-index of 0.702, which is
		  higher than the results achieved with only
		  histopathological images (0.509) and Cox-PASNet (0.640).
		  More importantly, PAGE-Net can simultaneously identify
		  histopathological and genomic prognostic factors associated
		  with patients survivals. The source code of PAGE-Net is
		  publicly available at

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Therapies may be more efficacious when
		  targeting a patient subpopulation with specific attributes,
		  thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In
		  the CRYSTAL study, patients with metastatic colorectal
		  cancer (mCRC) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or
		  FOLFIRI alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxic
		  effects or withdrawal of consent. OBJECTIVE: To determine
		  if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic biomarker
		  detection improves cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We used
		  individual patient data from CRYSTAL to compare the
		  cost-effectiveness, cost per life-year (LY) and cost per
		  quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI
		  versus FOLFIRI alone in three cohorts of patients with
		  mCRC: all randomised patients (intent-to-treat; ITT),
		  tumours with no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of
		  exon 2 of the KRAS protein ('KRAS wt') and no detectable
		  mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 4
		  of NRAS ('RAS wt'). Survival analysis was conducted using
		  RStudio, and a cost-utility model was modified to allow
		  comparison of the three cohorts. RESULTS: The deterministic
		  base-case ICER (cost per QALY gained) was pound130,929 in
		  the ITT, pound72,053 in the KRAS wt and pound44,185 in the
		  RAS wt cohorts for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with
		  FOLFIRI alone. At a pound50,000 willingness-to-pay
		  threshold, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI has a 2.8, 20 and 63{\%}
		  probability of being cost-effective for the ITT, KRAS wt
		  and RAS wt cohorts, respectively, versus FOLFIRI alone.
		  CONCLUSION: Screening for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS
		  may provide the most cost-effective approach to patient
		  selection.},

		  association of involuntary smoking with oral cavity cancer
		  is not established, though evidence on such an association

		  cancer. Studies of oral cavity cancer for these forms of
		  tobacco smoking would be of interest as a future direction
		  of research. Both case-control and cohort studies support
		  the independent effect of alcohol drinking on risk of oral
		  cavity cancer, with strong dose-response relationships
		  measured by frequency or duration of alcohol drinking.
		  Betel quid with or without tobacco is also confirmed to be
		  carcinogenic. Cessation of alcohol drinking reduces risks,
		  with risks returning to those of never drinkers after 10
		  years. All types of alcoholic beverages confer an excess

		  has so far been limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
		  This study was designed to assess the feasibility of in
		  vivo confocal endomicroscopy of different regions of the
		  oropharyngeal mucosa and to evaluate different contrast
		  agents. We examined five different regions of the human
		  oropharynx in vivo, and images were collected in real time
		  by using a confocal laser endoscope as formerly described
		  for the GI tract. Additionally ex vivo specimens were
		  examined using a topical contrast agent. Confocal scanning
		  was performed at 488-nm illumination for excitation of
		  exogenously applied fluorophores (topical acriflavine and
		  intravenous fluorescein). Confocal endomicroscopy allowed
		  for visualization of cellular and subcellular structures of
		  the anterior human oropharyngeal region. Fluorescein
		  staining yielded architectural details of the surface
		  epithelium and also subepithelial layers. Images taken at
		  increasing depth beneath the epithelium showed the mucosal
		  capillary network. Acriflavine strongly contrasted the cell
		  nuclei of the surface epithelium. The findings correlated
		  well with the histology of biopsy specimens. This is the

  abstract	= {An environment of high glucose concentration stimulates
		  the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) in mesangial
		  cell (MC) cultures. This may result from a similar increase
		  in intracellular glucose concentration. We theorized that
		  increased uptake, rather than glucose concentration per se
		  is the major determinant of exaggerated ECM formation. To
		  test this, we compared the effects of 35 mM glucose on ECM
		  synthesis in normal MCs with those of 8 mM glucose in the
		  same cells overexpressing the glucose transporter GLUT1
		  (MCGT1). Increasing medium glucose from 8 to 35 mM caused
		  normal MCs to increase total collagen synthesis and
		  catabolism, with a net 81-90{\%} increase in accumulation.
		  MCs transduced with the human GLUT1 gene (MCGT1) grown in 8
		  mM glucose had a 10-fold greater GLUT1 protein expression
		  and a 1.9, 2.1, and 2.5-fold increase in cell myo-inositol,
		  lactate production, and cell sorbitol content,
		  respectively, as compared to control MCs transduced with
		  bacterial beta-galactosidase (MCLacZ). MCGT1 also
		  demonstrated increased glucose uptake (5-fold) and
		  increased net utilization (43-fold), and greater synthesis
		  of individual ECM components than MCLacZ. In addition,
		  total collagen synthesis and catabolism were also enhanced
		  with a net collagen accumulation 111-118{\%} greater than
		  controls. Thus, glucose transport activity is an important
		  modulator of ECM formation by MCs; the presence of high
		  extracellular glucose concentrations is not necessarily
		  required for the stimulation of matrix synthesis.},

  abstract	= {One of the main objectives in systems biology is to
		  understand the biological mechanisms that give rise to the
		  phenotype of a microorganism by using high-throughput
		  technologies (HTs) and genome-scale mathematical modeling.
		  The computational modeling of genome-scale metabolic
		  reconstructions is one systemic and quantitative strategy
		  for characterizing the metabolic phenotype associated with
		  human diseases and potentially for designing drugs with
		  optimal clinical effects. The purpose of this short review
		  is to describe how computational modeling, including the
		  specific case of constraint-based modeling, can be used to
		  explore, characterize, and predict the metabolic capacities
		  that distinguish the metabolic phenotype of cancer cell
		  lines. As we show herein, this computational framework is
		  far from a pure theoretical description, and to ensure
		  proper biological interpretation, it is necessary to
		  integrate high-throughput data and generate predictions for
		  later experimental assessment. Hence, genome-scale modeling
		  serves as a platform for the following: (1) the integration
		  of data from HTs, (2) the assessment of how metabolic
		  activity is related to phenotype in cancer cell lines, and
		  (3) the design of new experiments to evaluate the outcomes
		  of the in silico analysis. By combining the functions
		  described above, we show that computational modeling is a
		  useful methodology to construct an integrative, systemic,
		  and quantitative scheme for understanding the metabolic
		  profiles of cancer cell lines, a first step to determine
		  the metabolic mechanism by which cancer cells maintain and
		  support their malignant phenotype in human tissues.},

		  Somatic hepatocyte-specific inactivation of TRIM24, TRIM28,

		  lines is that they are derived from primary and secondary
		  tumours resected from a single patient. As such, they may
		  represent a valuable resource for examining genetic changes
		  late in colon cancer progression. In order to verify this,
		  both cell lines have been characterized to determine
		  whether phenotypic differences have been retained despite
		  long-term cell culture in vitro. The primary tumour-derived
		  SW480 cells have an epithelioid morphology in vitro, while
		  metastasis-derived SW620 cells have a fibroblast-like

		  phenomenon clearly indicates that lactate is not a

		  metastases and overall survival of patients, as shown by
		  several studies of different entities. Metastasis of tumors
		  is promoted by lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by
		  tumor-associated fibroblasts that create a milieu favorable

		  high lactate levels in wound healing, chronic inflammation,
		  and cancer development. Tumor cells ensure sufficient
		  oxygen and nutrient supply for proliferation through

  abstract	= {The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a
		  vital role in carcinogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of
		  many epithelial tumors including oral squamous cell
		  carcinoma (OSCC), a common malignancy of the head and neck.
		  However, the functional role of the actin-sequestering
		  protein thymosin {\$}\beta{\$}4 (T{\$}\beta{\$}4) in the
		  EMT in OSCCs remains unclear. Thus, we investigated whether
		  overexpression of T{\$}\beta{\$}4 could induce in vitro
		  tumorigenesis such as cell proliferation and anchorage
		  independency and an EMT-like phenotype in OSCCs. Also, we
		  examined whether it affects invasiveness and cell
		  motility-associated signaling molecules.
		  T{\$}\beta{\$}4-overexpressing OSCCs,
		  SCC-15{\{}{\_}{\}}T{\$}\beta{\$}4 and
		  SCC-25{\{}{\_}{\}}T{\$}\beta{\$}4, enhanced cell
		  proliferation and colony formation. In addition, we
		  observed that T{\$}\beta{\$}4 overexpression induced an
		  EMT-like phenotype, accompanied by a decrease in expression
		  of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin and an increase in
		  expression of mesenchymal cell markers vimentin and
		  N-cadherin. Also, the expression level of Twist1, an
		  EMT-inducing transcription factor, was significantly
		  enhanced in SCC-15{\{}{\_}{\}}T{\$}\beta{\$}4 and
		  SCC-25{\{}{\_}{\}}T{\$}\beta{\$}4 cells. T{\$}\beta{\$}4
		  overexpression augmented in vitro invasion and MMP-2
		  activity and enhanced the phosphorylation of paxillin and
		  cortactin and expression of LIMK1. Taken together, these
		  results suggest that T{\$}\beta{\$}4 overexpression could
		  be one of the causes of tumorigenesis and progression in
		  OSCCs. Further investigation on the T{\$}\beta{\$}4

  abstract	= {Background Identifying patients at high risk for
		  recurrence in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
		  is the key to choose patients who can benefit from
		  postoperative adjuvant therapy. However, the criteria to
		  stratify patients to receive postoperative adjuvant therapy
		  is still clinicopathologic factor-oriented such as
		  differentiation, tumor size, the presence of pleural
		  involvement and vascular invasion and so on. Even using
		  adjuvant treatment under these criteria, 5 - year survival
		  rate is around 60{\%} even in early-stage disease. Here, we
		  extracted potential candidate genes for stratifying
		  resected NSCLC patients according to correlation with their
		  survival using public big data and validated the prognostic
		  role of the extracted candidate gene in tumor samples of
		  patients' cohort with resected NSCLC. Method Using
		  hypothesis “X-negative implies Y-positive.” (X:
		  regulatory gene, Y: prognosis related gene), we extracted
		  (X,Y) gene pairs in TCGA RNA seq expression data of stage
		  I-IIIA resected NSCLC. Then, among extracted (X,Y) gene
		  pairs, we choose only appropriate (X,Y) gene pairs
		  according to their biology during the tumorigenesis
		  process. We validated these extracted gene pairs as
		  prognostic factors in 111 patients with surgically resected
		  NSCLC at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital of the Catholic Medical
		  Center between 2007 and 2011 with immunohistochemical (IHC)
		  staining of each molecule. Results In TCGA database, we
		  found 21 regulatory genes and 38 prognosis-related-gene
		  pairs in lung adenocarcinoma. Among them, VEGFC-ITGA5 pair
		  was suggested to be relevant to tumorigenesis in the
		  previous studies. In tumour tissues of 111 patients of
		  resected NSCLC, the expression of ITGA5 was statistically
		  correlated with that of VEGFC (P = 0.015). In the patients
		  with low expression of ITGA5, disease-free survival was
		  longer than that in those with high expression (79.4 months
		  vs 59.1 months, P = 0.049) Conclusion lITGA5 which affects
		  VEGFC might one of the potential biomarkers relevant
		  prognosis in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma.},

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: With the continued improvement of requisite
		  mass spectrometers and UHPLC systems, Hydrogen/Deuterium
		  eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) workflows are rapidly
		  evolving towards the investigation of more challenging
		  biological systems, including large protein complexes and
		  membrane proteins. The analysis of such extensive systems
		  results in very large HDX-MS datasets for which specific
		  analysis tools are required to speed up data validation and
		  interpretation. RESULTS: We introduce a web application and
		  a new R-package named 'MEMHDX' to help users analyze,
		  validate and visualize large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX is
		  composed of two elements. A statistical tool aids in the
		  validation of the results by applying a mixed-effects model
		  for each peptide, in each experimental condition, and at
		  each time point, taking into account the time dependency of
		  the HDX reaction and number of independent replicates. Two
		  adjusted P-values are generated per peptide, one for the
		  'Change in dynamics' and one for the 'Magnitude of DeltaD',
		  and are used to classify the data by means of a 'Logit'
		  representation. A user-friendly interface developed with
		  Shiny by RStudio facilitates the use of the package. This
		  interactive tool allows the user to easily and rapidly
		  validate, visualize and compare the relative deuterium
		  incorporation on the amino acid sequence and 3D structure,
		  providing both spatial and temporal information.
		  AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MEMHDX is freely available

  abstract	= {The clinical use of several first generation HIV protease
		  inhibitors (PIs) is associated with the development of
		  insulin resistance. Indinavir has been shown to act as a
		  potent reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of zero-trans
		  glucose influx via direct interaction with the insulin
		  responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4. Newer
		  drugs within this class have differing effects on insulin
		  sensitivity in treated patients. GLUTs are known to contain
		  two distinct glucose-binding sites that are located on
		  opposite sides of the lipid bilayer. To determine whether
		  interference with the cytoplasmic glucose binding site is
		  responsible for differential effects of PIs on glucose
		  transport, intact intracellular membrane vesicles
		  containing GLUT1 and GLUT4, which have an inverted
		  transporter orientation relative to the plasma membrane,
		  were isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The binding of
		  biotinylated ATB-BMPA, a membrane impermeable bis-mannose
		  containing photolabel, was determined in the presence of
		  indinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, and
		  cytochalasin b. Zero-trans 2-deoxyglucose transport was
		  measured in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and primary rat
		  adipocytes acutely exposed to these compounds. PI
		  inhibition of glucose transport correlated strongly with
		  the PI inhibition of ATB-BMPA/transporter binding. At
		  therapeutically relevant concentrations, ritonavir was not
		  selective for GLUT4 over GLUT1. Indinavir was found to act
		  as a competitive inhibitor of the cytoplasmic glucose
		  binding site of GLUT4 with a K(I) of 8.2 µM. These data
		  establish biotinylated ATB-BMPA as an effective probe to
		  quantify accessibility of the endofacial glucose-binding
		  site in GLUTs and reveal that the ability of PIs to block
		  this site differs among drugs within this class. This
		  provides mechanistic insight into the basis for the
		  clinical variation in drug-related metabolic toxicity.},

		  Very few studies examine the impacts of psychotherapy on

		  either 8 weekly body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy
		  sessions or 1 educational (EDU) session. Self-report
		  measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II
		  (BDI-II), and the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ)
		  including two subscales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search.
		  Salivary cortisol levels were collected by the subjects in
		  their homes at the time of awakening, 30 and 45 min after
		  awakening, and at 12.00, 17.00, and 21.00 h. Measurement
		  time points include baseline, the 2nd month (completion of

  abstract	= {Background: Neuroendocrine dysregulation influenced by
		  psychosocial stress is related to breast cancer recurrence.
		  Very few studies examine the impacts of psychotherapy on
		  diurnal cortisol patterns among breast cancer survivors.
		  Methods: Forty-eight breast cancer patients who completed
		  active cancer treatment were randomly assigned to receive
		  either 8 weekly body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy
		  sessions or 1 educational (EDU) session. Self-report
		  measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II
		  (BDI-II), and the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ)
		  including two subscales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search.
		  Salivary cortisol levels were collected by the subjects in
		  their homes at the time of awakening, 30 and 45 min after
		  awakening, and at 12.00, 17.00, and 21.00 h. Measurement
		  time points include baseline, the 2nd month (completion of
		  BMS therapy), the 5th month, and the 8th month. Results:
		  There were no significant differences in BDI-II scores
		  (p{\textgreater}0.05) and MLQ-Presence scores (p
		  {\textgreater}0.05) between BMS and EDU groups at baseline
		  or across the three follow-ups. Nevertheless, greater
		  MLQ-Search scores were found in the BMS group compared to

		  enhancing an active search for meaning in life toward more

		  potential to ameliorate degenerative disorders and to
		  repair damaged tissues. The homing of transplanted MSCs to

		  aim was to identify microRNAs involved in controlling MSC
		  proliferation and migration. MSCs can be isolated from bone
		  marrow and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (BM-MSCs and
		  WJ-MSCs, respectively), and WJ-MSCs show poorer motility
		  yet have a better amplification rate compared with BM-MSCs.
		  Small RNA sequencing revealed that miR-146a-5p is
		  significantly overexpressed and has high abundance in
		  WJ-MSCs. Knockdown of miR-146a-5p in WJ-MSCs inhibited
		  their proliferation yet enhanced their migration, whereas
		  overexpression of miR-146a-5p in BM-MSCs did not influence
		  their osteogenic and adipogenic potentials. Chemokine
		  (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), together with SIKE1,
		  which is an I-kappa-B kinase epsilon (IKK$\epsilon$)
		  suppressor, is a direct target of miR-146a-5p in MSCs.
		  Knockdown of miR-146a-5p resulted in the down-regulation of
		  nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-$\kappa$B) activity, which is
		  highly activated in WJ-MSCs and is known to activate
		  miR-146a-5p promoter. miR-146a-5p is also downstream of
		  CXCL12, and a negative feedback loop is therefore formed in
		  MSCs. These findings suggest that miR-146a-5p is critical
		  to the uncoupling of motility and proliferation of MSCs.
		  Our miRNome data also provide a roadmap for further

		  cancer remains unclear. We determined the correlation
		  between IL-19 expression levels and clinicopathological
		  variables and explored the effects of IL-19 on the
		  esophageal SCC in vivo and in vitro. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
		  FINDINGS: We determined the expression levels of esophageal
		  SCC tissues from 60 patients using immunohistochemistry. We
		  examined the effects of IL-19 on intracellular signaling,
		  cytokines production as well as proliferation,
		  colonization, and migration in the human esophageal SCC
		  cell line CE81T. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IL-19
		  (1BB1) and its receptor IL-20R1 (51D) were used to
		  antagonize the effects of IL-19. We injected SCID mice with
		  CE81T cells and then treated them with anti-IL-19 mAb or
		  control IgG every 3 days and determined tumor growth for 32
		  days. Of the 60 esophageal SCC patients, 36 patients
		  (60{\%}) were IL-19 strongly stained, which was associated
		  with advanced tumor stage. CE81T cells expressed IL-19 and
		  its receptors. IL-19 induced phosphorylation of STAT3, P38,
		  JNK, ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-$\kappa$B in CE81T cells. IL-19
		  promoted the proliferation, colonization, and migration of
		  CE81T cells, which were antagonized by 1BB1 and 51D. IL-19
		  also induced expression of the transcripts of TGF-$\beta$,
		  cyclin B1, CXCR4, and MMP-1 in CE81T cells. In CE81T
		  tumor-bearing mice, 1BB1 reduced tumor growth and
		  downregulated TGF-$\beta$, cyclin B1, MMP-1, and CXCR4
		  expression in tumors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: IL-19
		  affects the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. IL-19 mAb

  abstract	= {Background: Pharmacological interactions are useful for
		  understanding ligand binding mechanisms of a therapeutic
		  target. These interactions are often inferred from a set of
		  active compounds that were acquired experimentally.
		  Moreover, most docking programs loosely coupled the stages
		  (binding-site and ligand preparations, virtual screening,
		  and post-screening analysis) of structure-based virtual
		  screening (VS). An integrated VS environment, which
		  provides the friendly interface to seamlessly combine these
		  VS stages and to identify the pharmacological interactions
		  directly from screening compounds, is valuable for drug
		  discovery.Results: We developed an easy-to-use graphic
		  environment, iGEMDOCK, integrating VS stages (from
		  preparations to post-screening analysis). For
		  post-screening analysis, iGEMDOCK provides biological
		  insights by deriving the pharmacological interactions from
		  screening compounds without relying on the experimental
		  data of active compounds. The pharmacological interactions
		  represent conserved interacting residues, which often form
		  binding pockets with specific physico-chemical properties,
		  to play the essential functions of a target protein. Our
		  experimental results show that the pharmacological
		  interactions derived by iGEMDOCK are often hot spots
		  involving in the biological functions. In addition,
		  iGEMDOCK provides the visualizations of the

		  analysis.Conclusions: We have developed iGEMDOCK to
		  facilitate steps from preparations of target proteins and
		  ligand libraries toward post-screening analysis. iGEMDOCK
		  is especially useful for post-screening analysis and
		  inferring pharmacological interactions from screening
		  compounds. We believe that iGEMDOCK is useful for

		  activities, CCN1 increases the cytotoxicities of the tumour

		  in fibroblasts. We aimed to determine the physiological
		  function of CCN1 in an injured heart. METHODS AND RESULTS:
		  To assess the function of CCN1 in vivo, knock-in mice
		  carrying the apoptosis-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were
		  tested in an isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury
		  model (100 mg/kg/day of sc injected ISO for 5 days).
		  Compared with wild-type mice, Ccn1(dm/dm) mice were
		  remarkably resistant to ISO-induced cardiac injury; they
		  showed no post-treatment cardiomyocyte apoptosis or
		  myocardial tissue damage. ISO cardiotoxicity was dependent
		  on Fas ligand (FasL) and its downstream signalling. Using
		  primary cultures of cardiomyocytes isolated from rats, we
		  demonstrated that CCN1 sensitized FasL-mediated apoptosis
		  by engaging its cell-surface receptor integrin
		  $\alpha$6$\beta$1 and up-regulating intracellular reactive
		  oxygen species (ROS), which activated mitogen-activated
		  protein kinase p38, and increased cell-surface Fas
		  expression. CONCLUSION: CCN1 is a critical
		  pathophysiological regulator that mediates cardiomyocyte
		  apoptosis during work-overload-induced cardiac injury. CCN1
		  increases cellular susceptibility to Fas-induced apoptosis
		  by increasing ROS and cell-surface Fas expression.},

		  family proteins are major pathogen reorganization receptors
		  (PRR) responsible for detection of viral RNA, which
		  initiates antiviral response. Here, we evaluated the
		  functional role of one RLR family member, RIG-I, in human
		  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). RIG-I is
		  abundantly expressed both in poorly-differentiated primary
		  cancer and lymph node metastasis, but not in normal
		  adjacent tissues. Activation of RIG-I by transfection with
		  low dose of 5'-triphosphate RNA (3p-RNA) induces low levels
		  of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines and promotes
		  NF-$\kappa$B- and Akt-dependent cell proliferation,
		  migration and invasion. In contrast, activation of RIG-I by
		  a high dose of 3p-RNA induces robust mitochondria-derived
		  apoptosis accompanied by decreased activation of Akt, which
		  is independent of the interferon and TNF$\alpha$ receptor,
		  but can be rescued by over-expression of constitutively
		  active Akt. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments
		  indicate that the CARD domain of RIG-I is essential for
		  inducing apoptosis by interacting with caspase-9. Together,
		  our results reveal a dual role of RIG-I in HNSCC through
		  regulating activation of Akt, in which RIG-I activation by

		  survival, clinical responses, compliance, and adverse
		  effects in locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC)
		  patients treated with split-dose cisplatin-based concurrent
		  chemoradiation therapy (SD-CCRT) or cetuximab with
		  concurrent radiation therapy (BioRT).
		  
		  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 170
		  LAHNC patients diagnosed between January 1, 2009, and July
		  31, 2012: 116 received CCRT and 54 received BioRT.
		  
		  RESULTS: Complete response rates were similar in the
		  SD-CCRT and BioRT groups (63.8{\%} versus 59.3{\%}; P =
		  0.807), and locoregional relapse rates were 18.1{\%} and
		  13.0{\%}, respectively (P = 0.400). The 3-year relapse-free
		  survival rate was 65.8{\%} in the SD-CCRT group and
		  65.5{\%} in the BioRT group, respectively (P = 0.647). The
		  3-year overall survival rate was 78.5{\%} in the SD-CCRT
		  group and 70.9{\%} in the BioRT group, respectively (P =
		  0.879). Hematologic side effects were significantly more
		  frequent in the SD-CCRT than in the BioRT group. Mucositis
		  frequency was similar.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Primary SD-CCRT and BioRT both showed good
		  clinical response and survival. Hematologic toxicities were
		  more frequent, but tolerable, in the SD-CCRT group. Both
		  groups showed good compliance.},

		  gene family, which is known to inhibit the Wnt regulation
		  process, is widely found in cancers. However, the roles and
		  functions of specific family members in head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are still unclear. MATERIAL
		  AND METHODS Online bioinformatics tools (Oncomine, UALCAN,
		  Kaplan-Meier plotter, GEPIA, Metascape, and STRING) were
		  used to analyze the relationships between distinct DKKs and
		  HNSCC. The transcriptome expression, clinical association,
		  functions, pathways, and protein-protein interaction
		  networks of DKKs in HNSCC were explored. RESULTS The mRNA
		  expression of DKK1, DKK3, and Dickkopf-like acrosomal
		  protein 1 (DKKL1) in HNSCC was significantly higher than in
		  normal tissues, while that of DKK4 was lower. The mRNA
		  expression of DKK1, DKK3, and DKKL1 was elevated in
		  higher-grade HNSCC. The mRNA expression of DKK1 and DKK3
		  was elevated in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC,
		  while DKKL1 had a higher mRNA expression in HPV-positive
		  HNSCC. In addition, DKK1 was significantly associated with
		  unfavorable overall survival in HNSCC patients. DKK3 was
		  more likely to be a negative factor for the 5-year survival
		  rate, while DKK4 was the opposite. DKK1 function was mainly
		  enriched in GTPase-mediated signal transduction. Porcupine
		  O-acyltransferase, a key regulator of the Wnt signaling
		  pathway, was also associated with DKK1 in the
		  protein-protein interaction network. CONCLUSIONS With
		  regard to improving the therapeutic strategies of HNSCC in
		  the future, DKK1 could be an unfavorable prognostic
		  biomarker. DKK3, DKK4, and DKKL1 might be potential
		  biomarkers for HNSCC.},

		  inactivation mediated by integrin-linked kinase (ILK)

		  upregulation in Tbeta4-overexpressing SW480 cells seemed to
		  be attributed mainly to a stabilization of this kinase by
		  complexing with particularly interesting new Cys-His
		  protein (PINCH) more efficiently. In the meantime, a strong
		  correlation between the expression levels of Tbeta4, ILK
		  and E-cadherin in CRC patients was also revealed by

		  cancer-related death in year 2006, and it is the fifth
		  leading cause of cancer-related deaths in male population
		  on this island. The disease causes great morbidity, and the
		  five-year survival rate of less than 50 {\%} has not
		  improved in more than two decades. Squamous cell carcinoma
		  (SCC) is the most frequently a occurred cancer in the oral
		  and maxillofacial regions, and its metastatic and invasive
		  abilities tendencies made it difficult in prognostic
		  control. In our study, we determined infection efficiencies
		  in seven oral cancer cell lines and oral mucosa fibroblast
		  (OMF) with different lentivirus dosage. The results
		  suggested that using lentivirus for gene delivery is a
		  promising method. We used 20 MOI GL-lentivirus to infect
		  Ca922 and SAS cell lines to establish stable cell lines
		  with GL expression. The Ca922-GL and SAS-GL orthotopic
		  tumor models were established by these two stable cell
		  lines. Based on bioluminescent imaging observation, SAS was
		  highly invasive cell line, while Ca922-GL was not an
		  invasive cell line in vivo. In SAS-GL orthotopic model, a
		  metastatic tumor was observed on salivary gland. However,
		  in Ca922-GL orthotopic model, no metastatic tumor was found
		  in mice at all. Deguelin is a natural product and an AKT
		  inhibitor. In cell viability assay, Ca922, Cal27, and SAS
		  were sensitive to deguelin. To determine the inhibition
		  efficacy of deguelin treatment on tumor growth, we used
		  SAS-GL orthotopic tumor model with 0.8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg
		  deguelin treatment. In 4 mg/kg deguelin treatment, the
		  tumor volume in SAS-GL orthotopic tumor model was
		  significantly smaller than the control group. In addition,
		  treatment with 0.8 mg/kg deguelin in SAS-GL orthotopic
		  tumor model also resulted in a smaller tumor. Overall, our
		  results indicated that the tumor growth of oral cancer
		  could be inhibited by deguelin treatment, and this novel

		  actin-sequestering polypeptide that is involved in wound
		  healing and developmental processes, has been reported to
		  be strongly associated with tumorigenesis. A recent tissue
		  microarray analysis showed that T$\beta$4 was highly
		  expressed in certain tumor cells, including lung cancer.
		  However, the exact expression pattern and the role of
		  T$\beta$4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not to
		  our knowledge been investigated. In the present study, we
		  confirmed that T$\beta$4 expression was increased in NSCLC
		  tissues and cell lines. T$\beta$4 gene silencing in A549
		  and H1299 cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration,
		  and invasion in vitro and decreased tumor growth in vivo.
		  Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant decrease
		  in Notch1 activation in T$\beta$4 gene-silenced cells.
		  Moreover, restoring the Notch1 expression attenuated the

		  a risk factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but also a
		  potential biomarker for individualized treatment options.
		  This study aimed to investigate potential pathways and
		  genes associated with TP53 mutations in adult de novo AML.
		  Methods An RNA sequencing dataset of adult de novo AML was
		  downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database.
		  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by
		  edgeR of the R platform. Key pathways and genes were
		  identified using the following bioinformatics tools: gene
		  set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology (GO), the
		  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Search Tool
		  for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, and
		  Molecular Complex Detection. Results GSEA suggested that
		  TP53 mutations were significantly associated with cell
		  differentiation, proliferation, cell adhesion biological
		  processes, and MAPK pathway. In total, 1,287 genes were
		  identified as DEGs. GO and KEGG analysis suggested that
		  upregulation of DEGs was significantly enriched in
		  categories associated with cell adhesion biological
		  processes, Ras-associated protein 1, PI3K-Akt pathway, and
		  cell adhesion molecules. The top ten genes ranked by
		  degree, CDH1, BMP2, KDR, LEP, CASR, ITGA2B, APOE, MNX1,
		  NMU, and TRH, were identified as hub genes from the
		  protein-protein interaction network. Survival analysis
		  suggested that patients with TP53 mutations had a
		  significantly increased risk of death, while the mRNA
		  expression level in patients with TP53 mutation was similar
		  to those carrying TP53 wild type. Conclusion Our findings
		  have indicated that multiple genes and pathways may play a
		  crucial role in TP53 mutation AML, offering candidate
		  targets and strategies for TP53 mutation AML individualized

  abstract	= {In Taiwan, gastric cancer is ranked the sixth common
		  cancer and the fifth cancer mortality. Surgical resection
		  with radical lymph nodes dissection still plays an
		  important role for gastric cancer. Our studies found that
		  gastric cancer patients with SIRT3 expression have better
		  prognosis than those without. SIRT3 expression is an
		  independent better prognostic marker for overall survival.
		  Besides, we also found that Caspase-3 expression in gastric
		  cancer patients is related to favorable clinicopathological
		  features and a positive prognosis after curative surgery.
		  Furthermore, RhoA expression is associated with poor
		  prognosis in gastric cancer patients, expecially diffuse
		  type gastric cancer. SIRT3, Caspase-3 and RhoA may act as
		  prognostic markers in human gastric cancer. With regard to
		  signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, we found that
		  gastric cancer patients with positive c-Met expression had
		  poorer overall survival than patients without c-Met
		  expression (P = 0.043) and that Jagged1 expression
		  significantly correlated with c-Met expression (r = 0.301;
		  P = 0.004). In addition, Jagged1 activity increased after
		  HGF stimulation, which in turn increased the downstream
		  expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in a time dependent
		  manner. After knockdown of receptor, HGF was found to
		  increase the proliferation and migration ability in human
		  gastric cancer cells. However, overexpression of N1IC still
		  had no effect after HGF stimulation. Our study found a
		  feedback loop between the HGF/c-Met and Jagged1/Notch1
		  signaling. Furthermore, both HGF/c-Met and Notch1 signaling
		  triggered the COX-2 activity. In terms of histone
		  modification, we found that gastric cancer patients with
		  higher H3K4ac and H3K4me3 expression have favorable
		  prognosis than those with lower expression. In vitro and in
		  vivo study showed that gastric cancer cell proliferation,
		  migration and tumor growth were inhibited by histone
		  deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. H3K4ac expression is
		  associated with better clinicopathological appearances and
		  may act as a potential biomarkers in human gastric cancer.
		  These results suggest that gastric cancer progression is
		  not associated with a unique signaling pathway and that a
		  feedback loop may exist between the HGF/c-Met and Notch1
		  signaling pathways, which may result in therapeutic
		  resistance. Therefore, multi-modality therapies should be
		  considered for treating gastric cancer. Besides, our
		  studies found several predictive biomarkers for the
		  prognosis of gastric cancer patients. We hope our studies
		  could be helpful for the biological classification in the
		  future.},

  abstract	= {Objectives: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the
		  most common oral cancer with a poor prognosis owing to
		  limited understanding of the disease mechanisms. The aim of
		  this study was to explore and identify the potential
		  biomarkers in OSCC by integrated bioinformatics
		  analysis.Materials and Methods: Expression profiles of long
		  non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and
		  messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were downloaded from The Cancer
		  Genome Atlas (TCGA) and differentially expressed RNAs
		  (DERNAs) were subsequently identified in OSCC by
		  bioinformatics analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto
		  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis
		  were used to analyze DERNAs. Then, the competing endogenous
		  RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed in Cytoscape and the
		  protein -protein interaction (PPI) network was established
		  in the STRING database. We established a risk model to
		  predict the overall survival of OSCC on the basis of
		  DElncRNAs with Kaplan–Meier analysis and combined with
		  logrank p test. Furthermore, we identified potential
		  biomarkers by combining univariate Cox regression with
		  overall survival rate, which were then validated in Gene
		  Expression Omnibus (GEO), OSCC cell lines and OSCC
		  specimens.Results: A total of 1,919 DEmRNAs, 286 DElncRNAs
		  and 111 DEmiRNAs were found to be dysregulated in OSCC. A
		  ceRNA network included 46 DElncRNAs,7 DEmiRNAs and 10
		  DEmRNAs, and the PPI network included 712 DEmRNAs including
		  31 hub genes. Moreover, a 7 lncRNAs risk model was
		  established and four genes (CMA1, GNA14, HCG22, HOTTIP)
		  were identified as biomarkers on overall survival in
		  patients with OSCC.Conclusions: This study successfully
		  constructed a ceRNA network and a PPI network which play a
		  crucial role in OSCC. A risk model was established to
		  predict the prognosis, and four DERNAs are revealed with
		  overall survival in patients with OSCC, suggesting that
		  they may be potential biomarkers in tumor diagnosis and

  abstract	= {Thymosin beta4 is regarded as the main G-actin
		  sequestering peptide in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells.
		  It is also thought to be involved in cellular events like
		  cancerogenesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, blood coagulation
		  and wound healing. Thymosin beta4 has been previously
		  reported to localise intracellularly to the cytoplasm as
		  detected by immunofluorescence. It can be selectively
		  labelled at two of its glutamine-residues with fluorescent
		  Oregon Green cadaverine using transglutaminase; however,
		  this labelling does not interfere with its interaction with
		  G-actin. Here we show that after microinjection into intact
		  cells, fluorescently labelled thymosin beta4 has a diffuse
		  cytoplasmic and a pronounced nuclear staining. Enzymatic
		  cleavage of fluorescently labelled thymosin beta4 with
		  AsnC-endoproteinase yielded two mono-labelled fragments of
		  the peptide. After microinjection of these fragments, only
		  the larger N-terminal fragment, containing the proposed
		  actin-binding sequence exhibited nuclear localisation,
		  whereas the smaller C-terminal fragment remained confined
		  to the cytoplasm. We further showed that in digitonin
		  permeabilised and extracted cells, fluorescent thymosin
		  beta4 was solely localised within the cytoplasm, whereas it
		  was found concentrated within the cell nuclei after an
		  additional Triton X100 extraction. Therefore, we conclude
		  that thymosin beta4 is specifically translocated into the
		  cell nucleus by an active transport mechanism, requiring an
		  unidentified soluble cytoplasmic factor. Our data
		  furthermore suggest that this peptide may also serve as a
		  G-actin sequestering peptide in the nucleus, although
		  additional nuclear functions cannot be excluded.},

		  peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials
		  from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer
		  selected questions regarding relationships between

		  interventions (eg, mindfulness-based stress reduction) that
		  utilized psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcome measures in
		  breast cancer survivors. Specifically, this review sought
		  to examine the evidence regarding relationships between
		  spiritually based interventions, psychosocial-spiritual
		  outcomes, and biomarker outcomes in breast cancer
		  survivors. Methods A systematic search of 9 online
		  databases was conducted for articles of original research,
		  peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials
		  from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer
		  selected questions regarding relationships between
		  psychosocial-spiritual and physiological measures utilized
		  in spiritually based interventions. Implications for future
		  spiritually based interventions in breast cancer
		  survivorship are discussed. Results Twenty-two articles
		  were reviewed. Cortisol was the most common PNI biomarker
		  outcome studied. Compared with control groups, intervention
		  groups demonstrated positive mental health outcomes and
		  improved or stable neuroendocrine-immune profiles, although
		  limitations exist. Design methods have improved with regard
		  to increased use of comparison groups compared with
		  previous reviews. There are few spiritually based

		  diagnostic systems, the overall 5-year survival rate for
		  patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has
		  remained relatively poor over the past 2 decades.
		  Appropriate animal models need to be developed according to
		  the specific purpose of cancer research. However, most of
		  the currently available oral cancer cell lines do not
		  precisely reflect the characteristics of bone-invasive OSCC
		  and cannot serve as suitable tools in the development of
		  new therapeutic reagents against bone-invasive OSCC. Here,
		  we assessed the orthotopic and osteolytic mouse model with
		  newly established OSCC cell line. DESIGN: We assessed the
		  orthotopic and osteolytic mouse model using the newly
		  established OSCC cells. In addition, the incidences of
		  tumorigenesis and histopathological results were
		  determined. RESULTS: The newly established YD-39 cell line
		  grows in a monolayer sheet and has highly invasive. The
		  transplanted YD-39 cells developed stable tumours in the
		  tongues and calvaria region of the nude mice. The tumours
		  in nude mice grafted with YD-39 cells had a high incidence
		  of transplantability in both mouse models tested and a
		  similar morphology to their respective original tumour.
		  Therefore, both animal models might be feasible animal
		  models to assess the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs.
		  CONCLUSIONS: This type of animal model approach might be
		  has the added advantage of potentially accelerating the

  abstract	= {Betel-quid and areca-nut chewing - a traditional habit
		  widely practiced in many parts of Asia - is also popular
		  among immigrants resident in the United Kingdom, other
		  parts of Europe, North America and Australia. An
		  international working group of scientific experts convened
		  by the Monographs Programme of the International Agency for
		  Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health
		  Organization, has reviewed the published studies related to
		  cancer and chewing betel quid and areca nut. A previous
		  evaluation in 1985 had found that chewing betel quid with
		  tobacco is carcinogenic to humans. The new evaluation goes
		  further to conclude that chewing betel quid without tobacco
		  is also carcinogenic to humans. The working group also
		  concluded that the areca nut, a common component of many
		  different chewing habits, is carcinogenic to humans. A
		  WIDESPREAD HABIT Betel quid generally consists of betel
		  leaf (from the Piper betle vine), areca nut (from the Areca
		  catechu tree), and slaked lime (predominantly calcium
		  hydroxide), to which tobacco is often added. Other
		  ingredients and flavouring agents can be included according
		  to local preferences and practices. Betel-quid and
		  areca-nut chewing are widely practiced in many parts of
		  Asia and in Asian-migrant communities elsewhere in the
		  world, with hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Betel
		  quid is chewed for many reasons, including for its
		  stimulant effects, to satisfy hunger, to sweeten the
		  breath, and as a social and cultural practice. Traditional
		  as well as commercially packaged products are now freely
		  available in pan shops in many cities outside Asia. The
		  United Kingdom is the number one importing country outside
		  of Asia, with imports having doubled since the early 80's.
		  In some immigrant communities a large majority is using
		  these products. Young children start using sweetened
		  areca-nut products, often adding tobacco later in their
		  adolescence. A CANCER-CAUSING HABIT The expert working
		  group has determined that betel quid with tobacco causes
		  oral cancer, cancer of the pharynx, and cancer of the
		  oesophagus in humans. Betel quid without tobacco is now
		  known to cause oral cancer in humans. Areca nut, a common
		  component of all betel quid preparations, has been observed
		  to cause oral submucous fibrosis (a pre-cancerous condition
		  that can progress to malignant oral cancer), leading to the
		  determination that areca nut itself is carcinogenic to
		  humans. Studies among Asian migrant communities have
		  demonstrated a significantly higher risk for oral cancer
		  compared with natives of countries where they have settled.
		  The new evaluation of betel quid without tobacco was made
		  possible by recent epidemiologic studies from parts of the
		  world where tobacco generally is not added to the betel
		  quid. In addition, recent epidemiologic studies in South
		  Asia have been able to separate the effects of betel quid
		  use with and without tobacco. Oral cancers are more common
		  in parts of the world where betel quid is chewed. Of the
		  390,000 oral and oro-pharyngeal cancers estimated to occur
		  annually in the world, 228,000 (58{\%}) occur in South and
		  South-East Asia. In some parts of India, oral cancer is the
		  most common cancer. Striking evidence has emerged from
		  Taiwan, China, where the incidence of oral cancer in men
		  has tripled since the early 1980s, coinciding with a steep
		  rise since the early 1970s and predominantly among men, in
		  the practice of chewing betel quid. Tobacco generally is
		  not added to the betel quid in that region. A NEW CAUSE FOR
		  CONCERN In recent years, a variety of mass-produced,
		  pre-packaged areca-nut products have become available in
		  many countries around the world. Aggressive advertising,
		  targeted at the middle class and at children, has enhanced
		  the sales and use of these products. In some parts of
		  India, almost one out of three children and teenagers
		  regularly or occasionally chew these products. Some have
		  viewed such products without tobacco (for example, pan
		  masala) as a safe alternative to betel quid with tobacco.
		  The evidence shows that these products have led to oral
		  disease, even among children, and that use of these
		  products cannot be considered safe. Several states in India
		  have begun to regulate these products, and reductions in
		  oral disease and oral cancer can be expected to follow from
		  reductions in their use. THE IARC MONOGRAPHS The IARC
		  Monographs Programme publishes authoritative, independent
		  evaluations of carcinogenic risks to humans caused by a
		  variety of agents, mixtures and exposures. Each evaluation
		  is the product of deliberations by an international working
		  group of scientific experts. Since its inception in 1971,
		  the series has evaluated nearly 900 agents, and the IARC
		  Monographs have become known for their thoroughness,

		  Carl Rogers' person-centered theory was reviewed. Secondly,
		  a study on 1,661 workers was presented in which
		  psychological variables such as fatigue (FG), depression
		  (DP) and anxiety (AX) were found to be negatively
		  correlated with relationship scales concerning the workers'
		  perception of the person-centered attitudes (PCA) of their
		  superiors, the democratic leadership of their superiors
		  (DEM) and the overall activation (ACT) of their worksites.
		  Significant differences in FG, DP and AX were found among
		  workers who perceived of their superiors as having either
		  high or low PCA. Workers who reported that their superiors
		  had high PCA had significantly less FG, DP and AX than
		  those who perceived of their superiors as having low PCA.
		  Similar results were also obtained when high DEM/low DEM
		  and high ACT/low ACT were compared in terms of workers' FG,
		  DP and AX. Thus, the PCA of job superiors was considered to
		  be positively related to the mental health of workers.
		  Thirdly, PCA training in industry was introduced and
		  evaluated. A total of 137 trainees (managers) conducted
		  active listening, a basic skill in the PCAp, and filled out
		  a relationship inventory immediately afterwards, evaluating
		  themselves as listeners and their partners as listeners. A

  abstract	= {Only humans and higher primates have high uric acid blood
		  levels. Although high uric acid causes gout, it has been
		  linked with human longevity because of its hypothetical
		  antioxidant function. Recent studies reveal that p53 has
		  significant roles in cellular metabolism. One example of
		  this is an antioxidant function that potentially
		  contributes to tumor suppression. Here, we reported a first
		  beneficial link between p53 and uric acid. We identified
		  the uric acid transporter SLC2A9 (also known as GLUT9) as a
		  direct p53 target gene and a key downstream effector in the
		  reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through
		  transporting uric acid as a source of antioxidant.
		  Oxidative stress induced SLC2A9 expression in a
		  p53-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC2A9 by small
		  interfering RNA (siRNA) or anti-gout drugs such as
		  probenecid significantly increased ROS levels in an uric
		  acid-dependent manner and greatly sensitized cancer cells
		  to chemotherapeutic drugs. Conversely, expression of SLC2A9
		  reduced ROS and protected against DNA damage and cell
		  death, suggesting its antioxidant function. The increased
		  production of ROS because of p53 loss was rescued by SLC2A9
		  expression. Furthermore, decreased SLC2A9 expression was
		  observed in several cancer types and was associated with a
		  poorer prognosis. Our findings suggest that the p53-SLC2A9
		  pathway is a novel antioxidant mechanism that uses uric
		  acid to maintain ROS homeostasis and prevent accumulation
		  of ROS-associated damage that potentially contributes to
		  cancer development.Oncogene advance online publication, 26

		  affecting the head and neck region. Despite advances in
		  therapeutic options over the last few decades, treatment
		  toxicities and overall clinical outcomes have remained
		  disappointing, thereby underscoring a need to develop novel

		  arrest in HNC cells in vitro and suppressed the in vivo
		  tumor-forming capacity of HNC cells, as well as delayed the
		  growth of established tumor xenografts in mice. This
		  radiosensitization appeared to be mediated by alterations
		  in iron homeostasis and increased production of reactive
		  oxygen species, resulting in enhanced tumor oxidative
		  stress. Moreover, UROD was significantly overexpressed in
		  HNC patient biopsies. Lower preradiation UROD mRNA
		  expression correlated with improved disease-free survival,
		  suggesting that UROD could potentially be used to predict

		  tumor border to resection margin) in oral cancer surgery
		  remains unclear, and no study has determined the
		  differential impact of close surgical margin and
		  microscopic extension according to primary tumor size in
		  oral cancers. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the
		  clinical data of 325 patients with surgically treated oral
		  cavity squamous cell carcinomas to determine the effect of
		  a close surgical margin ({\textless}5 mm) (cSM5) on local
		  recurrence. In addition, the depth of microscopic tumor
		  infiltration was determined in 90 available surgical
		  specimens. Results: The cSM5 was not related to the risk of
		  local tumor recurrence in early-stage oral cancer, while it
		  significantly increased the rate of local tumor recurrence
		  in resectable advanced-stage oral cancers (hazard ratio
		  3.157, 95 {\%} confidence interval 1.050–9.407, p =

		  was a significant risk factor for local recurrence only in

		  is a novel trophic factor that has antimicrobial effects

		  ubiquitous, naturally-occurring peptide in the wound bed.
		  Therefore, the relationship between Tbeta4 and MSCs,

		  enhanced the proliferation of human ASCs, resulting in
		  prominent nuclear localization of PCNA immunoreactivity. In
		  addition, exogenous Tbeta4 also increased IL-8 secretion
		  and blocking of IL-8 with neutralizing antibodies decreased
		  Tbeta4-induced ASC proliferation, suggesting that IL-8 is a
		  critical mediator of Tbeta4-enhanced proliferation.
		  Moreover, Tbeta4 activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and

  abstract	= {A tumour control probability computational model for
		  fractionated radiotherapy was developed, with the goal of
		  incorporating the fundamental interplay between hypoxia and
		  proliferation, including reoxygenation over a course of
		  radiotherapy. The fundamental idea is that the local
		  delivery of oxygen and glucose limits the amount of
		  proliferation and metabolically-supported cell survival a
		  tumour sub-volume can support. The model has three
		  compartments: a proliferating compartment of cells
		  receiving oxygen and glucose; an intermediate,
		  metabolically-active compartment receiving glucose; and a
		  highly hypoxic compartment of starving cells. Following the
		  post-mitotic cell death of proliferating cells,
		  intermediate cells move into the proliferative compartment
		  and hypoxic cells move into the intermediate compartment. A
		  key advantage of the proposed model is that the initial
		  compartmental cell distribution is uniquely determined from
		  the assumed local growth fraction (GF) and volume doubling
		  time (TD) values. Varying initial cell state distributions,
		  based on the local (voxel) GF and TD, were simulated.
		  Tumour response was simulated for head and neck squamous
		  cell carcinoma using relevant parameter values based on
		  published sources. The tumour dose required to achieve a
		  50{\%} local control rate (TCD50) was found for various GFs
		  and TD's, and the effect of fraction size on TCD50 was
		  also evaluated. Due to the advantage of reoxygenation over
		  a course of radiotherapy, conventional fraction sizes
		  (2-2.4 Gy fx(-1)) were predicted to result in smaller
		  TCD50's than larger fraction sizes (4-5 Gy fx(-1)) for a 10
		  cc tumour with GFs of around 0.15. The time to eliminate
		  hypoxic cells (the reoxygenation time) was estimated for a
		  given GF and decreased as GF increased. The extra dose
		  required to overcome accelerated stem cell accumulation in
		  longer treatment schedules was estimated to be 0.68 Gy/day
		  (in EQD26.6), similar to published values derived from
		  clinical data. The model predicts, for a 2 Gy/weekday
		  fractionation, that increased initial proliferation (high
		  GF) should, surprisingly, lead to moderately higher local
		  control values. Tumour hypoxia is predicted to increase the
		  required dose for local control by approximately 30{\%}.
		  Predicted tumour regression patterns are consistent with
		  clinical observations. This simple yet flexible model shows
		  how the local competition for chemical resources might
		  impact local control rates under varying fractionation
		  conditions.},

  abstract	= {Feature selection is demanded in many modern scientific
		  research problems that use high-dimensional data. A typical
		  example is to identify gene signatures that are related to
		  a certain disease from high-dimensional gene expression
		  data. The expression of genes may have grouping structures,
		  for example, a group of co-regulated genes that have
		  similar biological functions tend to have similar
		  expressions. Thus it is preferable to take the grouping
		  structure into consideration to select features. In this
		  paper, we propose a Bayesian Robit regression method with
		  Hyper-LASSO priors (shortened by BayesHL) for feature
		  selection in high dimensional genomic data with grouping
		  structure. The main features of BayesHL include that it
		  discards more aggressively unrelated features than LASSO,
		  and it makes feature selection within groups automatically
		  without a pre-specified grouping structure. We apply
		  BayesHL in gene expression analysis to identify subsets of
		  genes that contribute to the 5-year survival outcome of
		  endometrial cancer (EC) patients. Results show that BayesHL
		  outperforms alternative methods (including LASSO, group
		  LASSO, supervised group LASSO, penalized logistic
		  regression, random forest, neural network, XGBoost and
		  knockoff) in terms of predictive power, sparsity and the

  abstract	= {Background. Obtaining adequate surgical margins, free of
		  tumor, is crucial for success in oncologic surgery. The
		  head and neck surgeon often finds that the tumor-free
		  margin reported from histopathologic measurement is
		  significantly smaller than the margin measured in-situ. It
		  was the purpose of this study to quantify the change in
		  size of mucosal and muscle surgical margins following
		  excision, formalin fixation, and slide preparation of
		  tongue and labiobuccal tissue in a canine model. Methods.
		  Ten mongrel dogs under general anesthesia for a concurrent
		  project were used in this study. Changes in mucosal and
		  muscle dimensions around custom-made brass disks, one with
		  a needle depth gauge, were measured immediately following
		  excision after formalin fixation and after slide
		  preparation. Results. The mean shrinkage from initial
		  resection to final microscopic assessment of the lingual
		  surface mucosal margins was 30.7{\%} (p {\textless}
		  0.0001). The deep tongue margin shrank 34.5{\%} (p
		  {\textless} 0.0001). The mean shrinkage of the labiobuccal
		  mucosal margin was 47.3{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). In all
		  cases, the greatest proportion of shrinkage occurred
		  immediately upon resection. Conclusions. From the in-situ
		  measurement by the surgeon to final pathologic evaluation
		  on the microscope slide, the measured dimensions of oral
		  cavity mucosal and tongue muscle margins shrink
		  significantly. To obtain 5 mm of pathologically clear
		  margin an in-situ margin of resection of at least 8 to 10
		  mm needs to be taken. Studies reporting clinical
		  correlation of recurrence and survival information with
		  surgical margin status should include a detailed

  abstract	= {Most head and neck cancers are derived from the mucosal
		  epithelium in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx and are
		  known collectively as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC). Oral cavity and larynx cancers are generally
		  associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse or both,
		  whereas pharynx cancers are increasingly attributed to
		  infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily
		  HPV-16. Thus, HNSCC can be separated into HPV-negative and
		  HPV-positive HNSCC. Despite evidence of histological
		  progression from cellular atypia through various degrees of
		  dysplasia, ultimately leading to invasive HNSCC, most
		  patients are diagnosed with late-stage HNSCC without a
		  clinically evident antecedent pre-malignant lesion.
		  Traditional staging of HNSCC using the
		  tumour–node–metastasis system has been supplemented by
		  the 2017 AJCC/UICC staging system, which incorporates
		  additional information relevant to HPV-positive disease.
		  Treatment is generally multimodal, consisting of surgery
		  followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for oral cavity cancers
		  and primary CRT for pharynx and larynx cancers. The EGFR
		  monoclonal antibody cetuximab is generally used in
		  combination with radiation in HPV-negative HNSCC where
		  comorbidities prevent the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
		  The FDA approved the immune checkpoint inhibitors
		  pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treatment of recurrent or
		  metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab as primary treatment for
		  unresectable disease. Elucidation of the molecular genetic
		  landscape of HNSCC over the past decade has revealed new
		  opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Ongoing efforts
		  aim to integrate our understanding of HNSCC biology and
		  immunobiology to identify predictive biomarkers that will
		  enable delivery of the most effective, least-toxic

		  mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has
		  remained unchanged for decades mainly due to advanced stage
		  of presentation and high rates of recurrence. Incomplete
		  surgical removal of the tumour, attributed to lack of
		  reliable methods to delineate the surgical margins, is a
		  major cause of disease recurrence. The predictability of
		  recurrence using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to delineate
		  surgical margins (PRISM) in mucosal HNSCC study aims to
		  redefine margin status by identifying the true extent of
		  the tumour at the molecular level by performing IHC with
		  molecular markers, eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF4Eand
		  tumour suppressor gene, p53, on the surgical margins and
		  test the use of Lugol's iodine and fluorescence
		  visualisation prior to the wide local excision. This
		  article describes the study protocol at its pre - results
		  stage. Methods and analysis PRISM-HNSCC is a bilateral
		  observational research being conducted in Darwin, Australia
		  and Vellore, India. Individuals diagnosed with HNSCC will
		  undergo the routine wide local excision of the tumour
		  followed by histopathological assessment. Tumours with
		  clear surgical margins that satisfy the exclusion criteria
		  will be selected for further staining of the margins with
		  eIF4E and p53 antibodies. Results of IHC staining will be
		  correlated with recurrences in an attempt to predict the
		  risk of disease recurrence. Patients in Darwin will undergo
		  intraoperative staining of the lesion with Lugol's iodine
		  and fluorescence visualisation to delineate the excision
		  margins while patients in Vellore will not undertake these
		  tests. The outcomes will be analysed. Ethics and
		  dissemination The PRISM-HNSCC study was approved by the
		  institutional ethics committees in Darwin (Human Research
		  Ethics Committee 13-2036) and Vellore (Institutional Review
		  Board Min. no. 8967). Outcomes will be disseminated through
		  publications in academic journals and presentations at
		  educational meetings and conferences. It will be presented
		  as dissertation at the Charles Darwin University. We will
		  communicate the study results to both participating sites.
		  Participating sites will communicate results with patients

  abstract	= {Although Fas ligand (FasL) is primarily expressed by
		  lymphoid cells, its receptor Fas (CD95/Apo-1) is broadly
		  expressed in numerous nonlymphoid tissues and can mediate
		  apoptosis of parenchymal cells upon injury and infiltration
		  of inflammatory cells. Here we show that CCN1 (CYR61) and
		  CCN2 (CTGF), matricellular proteins upregulated at sites of
		  inflammation and wound repair, synergize with FasL to
		  induce apoptosis by elevating cellular levels of reactive
		  oxygen species (ROS). CCN1 acts through engagement of
		  integrin $\alpha$6$\beta$1 and cell surface heparan sulfate
		  proteoglycans, leading to ROS-dependent hyperactivation of
		  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the presence of
		  FasL to enhance mitochondrial cytochrome c release. We show
		  that CCN1 activates neutral sphingomyelinase, which
		  functions as a key source of CCN1-induced ROS critical for
		  synergism with FasL. Furthermore, Fas-dependent hepatic
		  apoptosis induced by an agonistic monoclonal anti-Fas
		  antibody or intragastric administration of alcohol is
		  severely blunted in knock-in mice expressing an
		  apoptosis-defective Ccn1 allele. These results demonstrate
		  that CCN1 is a physiologic regulator of Fas-mediated
		  apoptosis and that the extracellular matrix
		  microenvironment can modulate Fas-dependent apoptosis
		  through CCN1 expression. Cell adhesion to several abundant
		  extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins via engagement of
		  integrin receptors is known to induce potent prosurvival
		  signals, whereas detachment from the ECM triggers many cell
		  types to undergo anoikis, a form of apoptotic cell death
		  (13). This regulation of cell survival through
		  integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a critical role in
		  controlling homeostasis and the integrity of tissue
		  architecture, whereas unligated or inappropriately ligated
		  integrins may elicit apoptotic signals (12). However,
		  during embryogenesis, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and
		  wound repair, death-inducing factors can provoke programmed
		  or apoptotic death in normal cells without requiring their
		  detachment from the ECM (4). Fas (CD95/APO-1) is a member
		  of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family of cell
		  surface death receptors that mediates apoptotic signals
		  upon binding to its specific ligand, FasL. Ligation of Fas
		  to FasL or its agonistic antibodies results in receptor
		  clustering, recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD, and
		  activation of the proteolytic caspase cascade (19, 50).
		  Whereas FasL is primarily expressed in activated T
		  lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and tissues of immune
		  privilege, Fas is broadly expressed in most lymphoid and
		  nonlymphoid tissues (50). Fas-mediated apoptosis is
		  critical for the regulation of the immune response,
		  including deletion of activated T and B lymphocytes, cell
		  death-inducing activity of cytotoxic T cells, and removal
		  of infiltrating lymphocytes in immune-privileged tissues
		  (19, 50). Fas also plays an important role in parenchymal
		  cell apoptosis in many organs during tissue injury and upon
		  inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes (7, 20, 38, 42,
		  46). Consistent with the notion that cell adhesion promotes
		  cell survival, integrin-matrix interactions inhibit
		  Fas-dependent apoptosis in a variety of cell types (22,
		  32). Thus, optimal apoptotic responses to Fas/FasL
		  signaling in adherent parenchymal cells must override the
		  cytoprotective effects of integrin-mediated cell adhesion.
		  In these instances, dynamic changes in the ECM induced by
		  inflammation or injury repair may establish conditions that
		  are permissive of, or conducive to, the apoptotic responses
		  to FasL. Recent studies have described the emergence of ECM
		  proteins that can induce or promote apoptosis (49, 60, 65).
		  Among them are members of the CCN family (9), which are
		  secreted cysteine-rich proteins that serve regulatory
		  rather than structural roles in the ECM and are therefore
		  considered matricellular proteins (6). CCN1 (CYR61) and
		  CCN2 (CTGF) support cell adhesion, stimulate cell
		  migration, induce angiogenesis, and promote chondrogenic
		  differentiation, exerting their functions primarily through
		  direct binding to integrin receptors. CCN1 and CCN2 promote
		  the survival of endothelial cells through integrin
		  $\alpha$v$\beta$3 but induce apoptosis in p21-deficient
		  fibroblasts through $\alpha$6$\beta$1 via a
		  caspase-8-independent mechanism (3, 40, 60). CCN1 and CCN2
		  are also critical for embryonic development, as Ccn1-null
		  mice die during midgestation due to cardiovascular
		  abnormalities and Ccn2-deficient mice perish perinatally as
		  a consequence of severe skeletal malformations (29, 47,
		  48). In the adult, CCN proteins are highly expressed at
		  sites of inflammation, injury repair, and tissue remodeling
		  and are implicated in diseases where inflammation plays a
		  role, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, and
		  cancer (9). Furthermore, the presence of CCN1 in the ECM
		  enables TNF-$\alpha$ to induce apoptotic death in normal
		  cells without inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B signaling or de
		  novo protein synthesis, conditions thought to be necessary
		  for TNF-$\alpha$ to be cytotoxic (10). Here we show that
		  CCN1 and CCN2 can synergize with FasL and significantly
		  enhance FasL-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts.
		  Mechanistically, CCN1 engages integrin $\alpha$6$\beta$1
		  and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs),
		  leading to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent
		  hyperactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
		  (MAPK) in the presence of FasL, which greatly enhances
		  mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosis. We show
		  that CCN1 is a novel activator of neutral sphingomyelinase
		  (nSMase), which is an essential contributor to CCN1-induced
		  ROS. Further, Fas-dependent hepatic cell death is greatly
		  diminished in knock-in mice expressing an
		  apoptosis-defective mutant of CCN1 that is unable to bind
		  $\alpha$6$\beta$1-HSPGs. Together, these results show that
		  CCN1 is a physiologic regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis
		  and indicate that Fas-dependent cell death at sites of
		  inflammation and injury repair may be controlled by the
		  matrix microenvironment through CCN1 expression.},

		  removal of lymph nodes in the neck, neck dissection is a
		  standard procedure for the management of patients with head

		  encompass several different forms of the procedure, which
		  may be selected based on the nature of the patient's
		  disease. Neck dissection was first described in the late
		  nineteenth century by von Langenbeck, Billroth, von
		  Volkmann, and Kocher, who developed and reported the early
		  cases of different types of neck dissection. Butlin, in
		  England, developed the concept of elective neck dissection.
		  However, it was George Crile, in 1906, who reported the
		  first significant series of cases on radical neck
		  dissection, bringing this procedure to the attention of the
		  medical world as an effective operation with reproducible
		  techniques and results. 1 The greatest impetus to the
		  status of this surgical procedure came from Martin et al. 2
		  In 1951, these researchers published a monumental report of
		  1,450 cases that established the place and technique of
		  radical neck dissection in the modern treatment of head and
		  neck cancer. The traditional radical neck dissection now is
		  reserved for patients with bulky metastatic neck disease
		  and those with a regional failure after a more limited neck
		  dissection. In 1967, Bocca described the concept of a
		  functional neck dissection with limited surgical morbidity,
		  for which the oncologic safety was equivalent to that of a

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Traditional in vitro cell invasion assays
		  focus on measuring one cell parameter at a time and are
		  often less than ideal in terms of reproducibility and
		  quantification. Further, many techniques are not suitable
		  for quantifying the advancing margin of collectively
		  migrating cells, arguably the most important area of
		  activity during tumor invasion. We have developed and
		  applied a highly quantitative, standardized, reproducible
		  Nest Expansion Assay (NEA) to measure cancer cell invasion
		  in vitro, which builds upon established wound-healing
		  techniques. This assay involves creating uniform circular
		  "nests" of cells within a monolayer of cells using a
		  stabilized, silicone-tipped drill press, and quantifying
		  the margin expansion into an overlaid extracellular matrix
		  (ECM)-like component using computer-assisted applications.
		  
		  FINDINGS: The NEA was applied to two human-derived breast
		  cell lines, MCF10A and MCF10A-CA1d, which exhibit opposite
		  degrees of tumorigenicity and invasion in vivo. Assays were
		  performed to incorporate various microenvironmental
		  conditions, in order to test their influence on cell
		  behavior and measures. Two types of computer-driven image
		  analysis were performed using Java's freely available
		  ImageJ software and its FracLac plugin to capture nest
		  expansion and fractal dimension, respectively - which are
		  both taken as indicators of invasiveness. Both analyses
		  confirmed that the NEA is highly reproducible, and that the
		  ECM component is key in defining invasive cell behavior.
		  Interestingly, both analyses also detected significant
		  differences between non-invasive and invasive cell lines,
		  across various microenvironments, and over time.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: The spatial nature of the NEA makes its outcome
		  susceptible to the global influence of many cellular
		  parameters at once (e.g., motility, protease secretion,
		  cell-cell adhesion). We propose the NEA as a mid-throughput
		  technique for screening and simultaneous examination of
		  factors contributing to cancer cell invasion, particularly
		  suitable for parameterizing and validating Cancer Systems
		  Biology approaches such as mathematical modeling.},

  abstract	= {The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization
		  has been systematically reinvestigated. Rates of barbed-end
		  elongation onto Spectrin.4.1. Actin seeds were measured by
		  right angle light scattering to avoid confounding effects
		  of pyrenyl-actin, and KINSIM was used to analyze elongation
		  progress curves. Without thymosin-beta4, both actin and
		  Profilin. Actin (P.A) are competent in barbed-end
		  polymerization, and kinetic simulations yielded the same
		  bimolecular rate constant ( approximately 10 x 10(6) M(-1)
		  s(-1)) for actin monomer or Profilin. Actin. When measured
		  in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a
		  0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a
		  simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for
		  Thymosin-beta4. Actin). The corresponding constant for
		  thymosin-beta4.pyrenyl-Actin, however, was significantly
		  higher ( approximately 9-10 microM), suggesting that the
		  fluorophore markedly weakens binding to thymosin-beta4.
		  With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or
		  4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with
		  increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM). Actin
		  assembly in presence of thymosin-beta4 and profilin fit a

		  earlier claim (D. Pantaloni and M.-F. Carlier (1993) Cell
		  75, 1007-1014) that profilin promotes nonequilibrium
		  filament assembly by accelerating hydrolysis of

  abstract	= {Glucocorticoids are widely used in the clinical setting as
		  remedies for inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and
		  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the
		  constant increase in the number of patients suffering from
		  glucocorticoid resistance could present a serious problem
		  for clinicians. In these cases, it may be reasonable to use
		  additional treatments to restore the therapeutic effect of
		  glucocorticoids. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and
		  18$\beta$-glycyrrhetinic acid (18$\beta$GA) are bioactive
		  compounds in licorice that have been used for thousands of
		  years in traditional Chinese medicine to treat coughs. We
		  showed that GA and 18$\beta$GA exhibit potential
		  anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. GA and
		  18$\beta$GA induced dual specificity protein phosphatase 1
		  (DUSP1) expression, and this effect was unchanged by the
		  addition of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist.
		  The stimulation of DUSP1 expression by GA and 18$\beta$GA
		  occurred via both glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PI3K
		  signaling, and the simultaneous activation of transcription
		  elements, such as AP1 (activator protein 1), CRE (cAMP
		  response element), GRE (glucocorticoid receptor element)
		  and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells), was
		  confirmed. Furthermore, we designed an in vitro
		  glucocorticoid resistance model to verify the effects of GA
		  and 18$\beta$GA on glucocorticoid resistance that was
		  induced by ROS. The data showed that these two
		  phytochemicals restored glucocorticoid sensitivity by
		  depleting ROS through HO-1 expression. p38 and NO, which
		  are factors that are induced by reactive oxygen species and
		  caused depletion of GR signaling, were inhibited by GA and
		  18$\beta$GA treatment. This phenomenon was considered to be
		  related to the coordinated modulation of GR and PI3K
		  signaling by GA and 18$\beta$GA, in conjugation with AP1,
		  CRE, GRE and NFAT activation. This study provides a
		  possible strategy for enhancing the efficacy of

		  The roles of ICIs for HNSCC treatments are emerging.
		  Method: We reviewed the study results of Programmed-Death 1
		  (PD-1) and PD-ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies for
		  HNSCC. The ongoing trials of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 were

		  pembrolizumab monotherapy (patients with PD-L1 Combined
		  Positive Score ≥ 20) or
		  pembrolizumab-platinum-fluorouracil improved overall
		  survival vs the EXTREME (cetuximab-platinum-fluorouracil).
		  Many HNSCC studies have combined anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy

		  (OM) is poorly standardized. Unidimensional size criteria
		  have shown to be unreliable in therapeutic decision-making.
		  We evaluate the size distribution of OM and scan for
		  associated clinicoradiological signs of aggressiveness.
		  Additionally, we evaluate three-dimensional size
		  delineation of OM aiming to improve future therapeutic
		  assessment of this destructive neoplasm. Methods:
		  Primarily, we reviewed the database "PubMed" for data
		  concerning the size of OMs as radiologically determined.
		  Afterwards, the impact of age, sex, locularity and location
		  on the size was investigated by $\chi$2 test, Student's
		  t-test and regression analysis. Furthermore, we
		  statistically evaluated the impact of size on the
		  occurrence of clinicoradiological signs of aggressiveness.
		  Secondly, we approximated the volume of five unpublished
		  cases of OM by semi-automatic image segmentation of
		  cone-beam CT images. Results: Multilocular OMs were
		  significantly larger than unilocular ones (p {\textless}
		  0.002). Age (0.042) and multilocularity ({\textless}0.002)
		  significantly impacted size. Size was significantly
		  associated with cortical perforation (0.032) and
		  multilocularity ({\textless}0.002), further regression
		  analysis revealed tooth resorption (0.019), cortical
		  perforation (0.005) and multilocularity ({\textless}0.002)
		  as significant predictors of size. Employing the volume as
		  a mean of comparison, we found that the biggest OM (38.42
		  ml; multilocular) was 124 times larger than the smallest
		  (0.31 ml; unilocular). However, using the maximum diameter
		  (cm) as a surrogate for size, the biggest lesion (6.3) was
		  only 5.25 times larger than the smallest (1.2).
		  Conclusions: Locularity and volumetric size
		  characterization might help in therapeutic decisionmaking
		  and could help to improve our understanding of OM.},

		  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ameloblastoma tissue
		  samples of patients treated at the Helsinki University
		  Hospital between the years 1983-2016. Tissue sections
		  underwent immunohistochemistry by Ventana BenchMark XT

		  for BRAF positivity and earlier onset as well as tumor
		  location. We used chi-squared tests and 2-by-2 table
		  functions to determine connections between BRAF positivity
		  and recurrence, growth pattern, and type. RESULTS:
		  BRAF-positive tumors occurred in younger patients compared
		  to BRAF-negative tumors (p = 0.015) and they located mostly
		  to the mandible (p {\textless} 0.001). Growth patterns were
		  limited to two in BRAF-negative tumors when BRAF-positive
		  tumors presented with one to four growth patterns (p =
		  0.02). None of the maxillary tumors showed BRAF positivity
		  and of these, 72.2{\%} recurred. CONCLUSIONS: An

  abstract	= {Background: Gene expression profiles have been broadly
		  used in cancer research as a diagnostic or prognostic
		  signature for the clinical outcome prediction such as
		  stage, grade, metastatic status, recurrence, and patient
		  survival, as well as to potentially improve patient
		  management. However, emerging evidence shows that gene
		  expression-based prediction varies between independent data
		  sets. One possible explanation of this effect is that
		  previous studies were focused on identifying genes with
		  large main effects associated with clinical outcomes. Thus,
		  non-linear interactions without large individual main
		  effects would be missed. The other possible explanation is
		  that gene expression as a single level of genomic data is
		  insufficient to explain the clinical outcomes of interest
		  since cancer can be dysregulated by multiple alterations
		  through genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome
		  levels. In order to overcome the variability of diagnostic
		  or prognostic predictors from gene expression alone and to
		  increase its predictive power, we need to integrate
		  multi-levels of genomic data and identify interactions
		  between them associated with clinical outcomes. Results:
		  Here, we proposed an integrative framework for identifying
		  interactions within/between multi-levels of genomic data
		  associated with cancer clinical outcomes using the
		  Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks (GENN). In order to
		  demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework, ovarian
		  cancer data from TCGA was used as a pilot task. We found
		  not only interactions within a single genomic level but
		  also interactions between multi-levels of genomic data

  abstract	= {Purpose: The goals of this study were to investigate the
		  clinical activity, safety, and biomarkers of dacomitinib,
		  an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, HER2,
		  and HER4, in recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell
		  carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M-SCCHN). Experimental
		  Design: Patients were eligible if the diseases were not
		  amenable to curative treatment and had progressed on
		  platinum-based chemotherapy, and were treated with
		  dacomitinib 45 mg/day. The primary endpoint was objective
		  response rate by RECISTv1.1. Exploratory analysis included
		  the characterization of somatic mutation, gene copy number,
		  gene expression, p16INK4A expression by IHC, and
		  investigation of their relationship with clinical outcomes.
		  Results: Forty-eight patients were evaluable for efficacy
		  and toxicity. Ten patients (20.8{\%}) had partial responses
		  and 31 patients (65{\%}) had stable diseases. The median
		  progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
		  were 3.9 months [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 2.9-5.0]
		  and 6.6 months (95{\%} CI, 5.4-10.3). Adverse events were
		  mostly grade 1-2. Mutations in the PI3K pathway (PIK3CA,
		  PTEN) and high expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL6,
		  IL8, IL1A, IL1B, IL4, and TNF) were significantly
		  associated with shorter PFS (2.9 vs. 4.9 months without
		  mutations, P = 0.013; 2.8 vs. 9.9 months with low
		  expression, P = 0.004). Those harboring PI3K pathway
		  mutations or high inflammatory cytokine expression had
		  shorter median OS (6.1 vs. 12.5 months lacking PI3K pathway
		  mutations and with low inflammatory cytokine expression, P
		  = 0.005). Conclusions: Dacomitinib demonstrated clinical
		  efficacy with manageable toxicity in platinum-failed
		  R/M-SCCHN patients. Screening of PI3K pathway mutation and
		  inflammatory cytokine expression may help identify which
		  R/M-SCCHN patients are likely to gain benefit from
		  dacomitinib. Clin Cancer Res; 21(3); 544-52. (C)2014 AACR.},

		  most researched test among the tools for assessing
		  psychopathology, and previous studies have established its
		  validity. Mood disorders are the most common mental
		  disorders worldwide; they present difficulties in early
		  detection, go undiagnosed in many cases, and have a poor
		  prognosis. (2) Methods: We analyzed a total of 8645
		  participants. We used the PHQ-9 to evaluate depressive
		  symptoms and the MDQ to evaluate hypomanic symptoms. We
		  used the 10 MMPI-2 Restructured Form scales and 23 Specific
		  Problems scales for the MMPI-2-RF as predictors. We
		  performed machine learning analysis using the k-nearest
		  neighbor classification, linear discriminant analysis, and
		  random forest classification. (3) Results: Through the
		  machine learning technique, depressive symptoms were
		  predicted with an AUC of 0.634–0.767, and the
		  corresponding value range for hypomanic symptoms was
		  0.770–0.840. When using RCd to predict depressive
		  symptoms, the AUC was 0.807, but this value was 0.840 when
		  using linear discriminant classification. When predicting
		  hypomanic symptoms with RC9, the AUC was 0.704, but this
		  value was 0.767 when using the linear discriminant method.
		  (4) Conclusions: Using machine learning analysis, we
		  defined that participants' mood symptoms could be
		  classified and predicted better than when using the
		  Restructured Clinical scales.},

  abstract	= {Glucose uptake into skeletal muscle is primarily mediated
		  by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). The number of GLUT4
		  polypeptides at the surface of muscle cells rises rapidly
		  in response to insulin, contraction, depolarization, or
		  energy deprivation. However, distinct mechanisms underlie
		  the gain in surface GLUT4 in each case. Insulin promotes
		  its exocytosis to the membrane, regulating vesicle
		  movement, tethering, docking, and fusion. In contrast,
		  muscle contraction, depolarization, and energy demand
		  reduce GLUT4 endocytosis. The signals involved in each case
		  also differ. Insulin utilizes Akt, Rabs, and selective
		  actin remodelling, whereas depolarization and energy
		  deprivation engage AMP-activated protein kinase and
		  Ca2+-dependent signals. GLUT4 internalizes via 2 major
		  routes that involve dynamin, but only one requires
		  clathrin. The clathrin-independent route is slowed down by
		  energy deprivation, and is regulated by AMP-activated
		  protein kinase. In addition to regulation of the exocytic
		  and endocytic movement of GLUT4, glucose uptake is also
		  modulated through changes in the transporter's intrinsic
		  activity. The glycolytic enzymes
		  glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase and hexokinase II contribute
		  to such regulation, through differential binding to

		  common neoplasms worldwide and characterized by local tumor
		  aggressiveness, high rate of early recurrences, development
		  of metastasis, and second primary cancers. Despite modern
		  therapeutic strategies and sophisticated surgical
		  management, overall survival-rates remained largely
		  unchanged over the last decades. Thus, the need for novel
		  treatment options for this tumor entity is undeniable. A
		  key event in carcinogenesis is the uncontrolled modulation
		  of genetic programs. Nuclear receptors belong to a large
		  superfamily of transcription factors implicated in a broad
		  spectrum of physiological and pathophysiological processes,
		  including cancer. Several nuclear receptors have also been
		  associated with head and neck cancer. This review will
		  summarize their mode of action, prognostic/therapeutic
		  relevance, as well as preclinical and clinical studies
		  currently targeting nuclear receptors in this tumor
		  entity.},

  abstract	= {Melanoma, although the least common form of skin cancer,
		  causes 80{\%} of associated deaths due to its metastatic
		  properties. It is highly refractory to treatment, and there
		  is therefore a great need for more effective therapeutic
		  options. Previous work in our lab has shown that CD24
		  expression can discriminate a highly aggressive and
		  drug-resistant subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
		  from within those cells that have undergone
		  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial
		  tumours. Melanomas are a nonepithelial tumour type arising
		  in a lineage that has undergone a developmental EMT, and we
		  therefore hypothesized that CD24 may also discriminate a
		  treatment-resistant CSC subpopulation in melanoma.
		  Cell-line work enabled us to identify a novel CSC
		  subpopulation in melanoma expressing CD24 alongside the
		  established melanoma stem cell marker CD271, and
		  demonstrated its resistance to current therapies including
		  BRAF inhibitors. We now want to establish whether such a
		  subpopulation exists in melanoma tumour specimens. The
		  purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel
		  population coexpressing CD24 and CD271 exists in patient
		  melanoma specimens and whether their presence correlates
		  with clinical characteristics and poor prognosis in
		  patients. We have built a new coimmunofluorescent staining
		  protocol for measurement of CD24 and CD271 staining on a
		  single-cell basis using the InCell 6000 automated confocal
		  screening microscope, enabling us to screen whole-tumour
		  sections and quantify staining on a single-cell basis. We
		  present here data showing precise quantification of CD24
		  and CD272 costaining using this protocol. We will next
		  stain primary and metastatic tumour specimens, localizing
		  staining within the specimens and correlating the size and
		  location of the CSC subpopulation with clinical
		  characteristics and patient outcome. This novel
		  treatment-resistant CSC subpopulation may present an
		  important cellular target for new melanoma therapeutics
		  that can help prevent the rapid recurrence currently seen
		  after therapy.},

		  Thymosin-beta4 is known as a 4.9-kd polypeptide that

		  malignant fibrosarcoma cell lines that have been

		  (32-S) transfected with sense thymosin-beta4 cDNA converted
		  the cells to develop tumors and formed numerous lung
		  metastases in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. In contrast,

  abstract	= {The capacity of immunity to control and shape cancer, that
		  is, cancer immunoediting, is the result of three processes
		  that function either independently or in sequence:
		  elimination (cancer immunosurveillance, in which immunity
		  functions as an extrinsic tumour suppressor in naive
		  hosts); equilibrium (expansion of transformed cells is held
		  in check by immunity); and escape (tumour cell variants
		  with dampened immunogenicity or the capacity to attenuate
		  immune responses grow into clinically apparent cancers).
		  Extensive experimental support now exists for the
		  elimination and escape processes because immunodeficient
		  mice develop more carcinogen-induced and spontaneous
		  cancers than wild-type mice, and tumour cells from
		  immunodeficient mice are more immunogenic than those from
		  immunocompetent mice. In contrast, the equilibrium process
		  was inferred largely from clinical observations, including
		  reports of transplantation of undetected (occult) cancer
		  from organ donor into immunosuppressed recipients. Herein
		  we use a mouse model of primary chemical carcinogenesis and
		  demonstrate that equilibrium occurs, is mechanistically
		  distinguishable from elimination and escape, and that
		  neoplastic cells in equilibrium are transformed but
		  proliferate poorly in vivo. We also show that tumour cells
		  in equilibrium are unedited but become edited when they
		  spontaneously escape immune control and grow into
		  clinically apparent tumours. These results reveal that, in
		  addition to destroying tumour cells and sculpting tumour
		  immunogenicity, the immune system of a naive mouse can also
		  restrain cancer growth for extended time periods.},

  abstract	= {Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in
		  predictive model building, because of the small number of
		  samples (n) compared to the huge amount of features (p).
		  This "n{\textless}{\textless}p" property has hampered
		  application of deep learning techniques for disease outcome
		  classification. Sparse learning by incorporating external
		  gene network information could be a potential solution to
		  this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because
		  (1) there are tens of thousands of features and only
		  hundreds of training samples, (2) the scale-free structure
		  of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of
		  convolutional neural networks. To address these issues and
		  build a robust classification model, we propose the
		  Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks (GEDFN), to
		  integrate external relational information of features into
		  the deep neural network architecture. The method is able to
		  achieve sparse connection between network layers to prevent

  abstract	= {Loss of function in tumor suppressor genes is commonly
		  associated with the onset/progression of cancer and
		  treatment resistance. The p53 tumor suppressor gene, a
		  master regulator of diverse cellular pathways, is
		  frequently altered in various cancers, for example, in
		  {\~{}}36{\%} of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and
		  {\~{}}68{\%} of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs).
		  Current methods for restoration of p53 expression,
		  including small molecules and DNA therapies, have yielded
		  progressive success, but each has formidable drawbacks.
		  Here, a redox-responsive nanoparticle (NP) platform is
		  engineered for effective delivery of p53-encoding synthetic
		  messenger RNA (mRNA). We demonstrate that the synthetic
		  p53-mRNA NPs markedly delay the growth of p53-null HCC and
		  NSCLC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We
		  also reveal that p53 restoration markedly improves the
		  sensitivity of these tumor cells to everolimus, a mammalian
		  target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that failed to show
		  clinical benefits in advanced HCC and NSCLC. Moreover,
		  cotargeting of tumor-suppressing p53 and tumorigenic mTOR
		  signaling pathways results in marked antitumor effects in
		  vitro and in multiple animal models of HCC and NSCLC. Our
		  findings indicate that restoration of tumor suppressors by
		  the synthetic mRNA NP delivery strategy could be combined
		  together with other therapies for potent combinatorial
		  cancer treatment.},

  abstract	= {Oncogenic mutations within RAS genes and inactivation of
		  p53 are the most common events in cancer. Earlier we
		  reported that activated Ras contributes to chromosome
		  instability, especially in p53-deficient cells. Here we
		  show that an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen
		  species (ROS) and oxidative DNA damage represents a major
		  mechanism of Ras-induced mutagenesis. Introduction of
		  oncogenic H- or N-Ras caused elevated intracellular ROS,
		  accumulation of 8-oxo-dG and increased number of chromosome
		  breaks in mitotic cells, which were prevented by
		  antioxidant N-acethyl-L-cysteine (NAC). By using Ras
		  mutants that selectively activate either of the three major
		  targets of Ras (Raf, RalGDS and PI3K) as well as
		  dominant-negative Rac1 and RalA mutants and inhibitors of
		  MEK1 and p38 MAPKs we have demonstrated that several Ras
		  effectors independently mediate ROS up-regulation.
		  Introduction of oncogenic RAS resulted in repression of
		  transcription from sestrin family genes SESN1 and SESN3,
		  which encode antioxidant modulators of peroxiredoxins.
		  Inhibition of mRNAs from these genes in control cells by
		  RNAi increased substantially ROS levels and mutagenesis.
		  Ectopic expression of SESN1 and SESN3 from lentiviral
		  constructs interfered with Ras-induced ROS increase
		  suggesting their important contribution to the effect. The
		  stability of Ras-induced increase in ROS was dependent on a
		  p53 function: in the p53-positive cells displaying
		  activation of p53 in response to Ras only transient (4–7
		  days) elevation of ROS was observed whereas in the
		  p53-deficient cells the up-regulation was permanent. The
		  reversion to normal ROS levels in the Ras-expressing
		  p53-positive cells correlated with up-regulation of
		  p53-responsive genes, including reactivation of SESN1 gene.
		  Thus, changes in expression of sestrins can represent
		  important determinant of genetic instability in neoplastic
		  cells showing simultaneous dysfunctions of Ras and p53.},

  abstract	= {Glucose is the main source of energy for the body,
		  requiring constant regulation of its blood concentration.
		  Insulin release by the pancreas induces glucose uptake by
		  insulin-sensitive tissues, most notably the brain, skeletal
		  muscle, and adipocytes. Patients suffering from type-2
		  diabetes and/or obesity often develop insulin resistance
		  and are unable to control their glucose homeostasis. New
		  insights into the mechanisms of insulin resistance may
		  provide new treatment strategies for type-2 diabetes. The
		  GLUT family of glucose transporters consists of thirteen
		  members distributed on different tissues throughout the
		  body. Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) is the major
		  transporter that mediates glucose uptake by insulin
		  sensitive tissues, such as the skeletal muscle. Upon
		  binding of insulin to its receptor, vesicles containing
		  GLUT4 translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma
		  membrane, inducing glucose uptake. Reduced GLUT4
		  translocation is one of the causes of insulin resistance in
		  type-2 diabetes. The translocation of GLUT4 from the
		  cytoplasm to the plasma membrane can be visualized by
		  immunocytochemistry, using fluorophore-conjugated
		  GLUT4-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a technique to
		  quantify total amounts of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma
		  membrane of cells during a chosen duration, using flow
		  cytometry. This protocol is rapid (less than 4 hours,
		  including incubation with insulin) and allows the analysis
		  of as few as 3,000 cells or as many as 1 million cells per
		  condition in a single experiment. It relies on anti-GLUT4
		  antibodies directed to an external epitope of the
		  transporter that bind to it as soon as it is exposed to the
		  extracellular medium after translocation to the plasma

		  phosphorylated downstream of insulin action and that leads
		  to regulated traffic of GLUT4. As GLUT4 vesicle fusion with
		  the plasma membrane is a highly regulated step in GLUT4
		  traffic, we investigated whether AS160 and 14-3-3
		  interactions are involved in this process. Fusion was
		  inhibited by a human truncated AS160 variant that
		  encompasses the first N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding
		  (PTB) domain, by either of the two N-terminal PTB domains,
		  and by a tandem construct of both PTB domains of rat AS160.
		  We also found that in vitro GLUT4 vesicle fusion was

		  and fusicoccin. To investigate the mode of interaction of
		  AS160 and 14-3-3, we examined insulin-dependent increases

		  14-3-3$\gamma$ was enriched on insulin-stimulated vesicles,

		  reproducible only if all used data are available and the
		  exploited computational analysis workflow is clearly
		  described. However, today for reproducing a complex
		  bioinformatics analysis, the raw data and the list of tools
		  used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the
		  reproducibility of the results obtained. Indeed, different
		  releases of the same tools and/or of the system libraries
		  (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky
		  reproducibility issues. Results: To address this challenge,
		  we established the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project

		  project has firstly to integrate her/his workflow modules

		  developed ad hoc by RPB to make easier this task. Secondly,
		  the workflow implementation must be realized in R according
		  to an R-skeleton function made available by RPB to
		  guarantee homogeneity and reusability among different RPB
		  functions. Moreover she/he has to provide the R vignette
		  explaining the package functionality together with an

  abstract	= {Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
		  exists within a microenvironment rich in immune cells.
		  Macrophages are particularly abundant in and around tumor
		  tissue, and have been implicated in the growth, malignancy,
		  and persistence of HNSCC (1). However, current literature
		  reports variable degrees of association between the density
		  of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and
		  clinicopathologic markers of disease (2, 3). These
		  inconsistent findings may be a result of differences in
		  approach to TAM detection. Authors have measured total TAMs
		  in tumor tissue, while others have stained tumor samples
		  for individual subtypes of TAMs, which include
		  pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and immunosuppressive (M2-like).
		  Our aim is to more clearly define the prognostic
		  significance of the phenotypes of tumor-associated
		  macrophages in HNSCC. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis
		  of the existing publications investigating the relationship
		  between TAMs (total and M2-like subtype) and T stage, nodal
		  involvement, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, and
		  tumor differentiation (Figure 1). A total of 12 studies
		  were included. Forest plots and risk ratios were generated
		  to report overall effect. Results: Higher density of both
		  total and M2-like subtype of TAMs in the tumor
		  microenvironment is associated with advanced T stage,
		  increased rates of nodal positivity, presence of vascular
		  invasion, and presence of lymphatic invasion (p {\textless}
		  0.0001; Figures 2–9). There is no significant association
		  between TAM density, either total or M2-like subtype, and
		  tumor differentiation (Figures 10, 11). Conclusions:
		  Increased density of TAMs, including those of the M2-like
		  phenotype, correlate with poor clinicopathologic markers in
		  HNSCC. Our findings warrant additional investigation into
		  the subpopulations of TAMs, the mechanisms behind their
		  recruitment and differentiation, and the associated
		  influence of each phenotype on tumor growth and invasion. A
		  greater understanding of TAM dynamics in HNSCC is critical
		  for directing further research and employing TAM-targeted
		  adjunct therapies.},

		  6.2.1.2 Factors Determining Surgical Margin Status Factors
		  Determining Surgical Margin StatusVarious factors can
		  contribute towards surgical margin status. This include
		  method of fixation of specimen, tumor site, choice of
		  surgical approach, pattern of invasion, perineural
		  invasion, lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, grade of
		  tumor, and skill of surgeon.
		  
		  Sutton et al. [39] in a series of 200 consecutive patients
		  who underwent primary surgical resection for oral cancer
		  investigated various factors that can contribute to the
		  close or positive margin. They used Batsakis classification
		  of surgical margin in this series and observed 42{\%} close
		  and 4.5{\%} positive margin. The close or positive margins
		  were associated with large size tumor ({\textgreater}2cm),
		  perineural invasion, lym-phovascular invasion, high-grade
		  tumor, and invasive tumor front. However the sur-gical
		  margin did not correlate with the surgical access and
		  between surgeons. This implies that close or positive
		  margin is a product of aggressive tumor rather than
		  inadequate surgical technique.
		  
		  This further underscores the fact that positive margin is a
		  marker of aggressive tumor biology. [28] Scholl P, Byers

		  ability to predict kinetic responses of novel regulatory
		  networks built from well-characterized biological
		  components. Surprisingly, few validated kinetic models of
		  complex regulatory networks have been derived by combining
		  models of the network components. A major bottleneck in
		  producing such models is the difficulty of measuring in

		  demonstrate that a simple, genetic approach to measuring
		  rate constants in vivo produces an accurate kinetic model
		  of the complex network that Saccharomyces cerevisiae
		  employs to regulate the expression of genes encoding
		  glucose transporters. The model predicts a transient pulse
		  of transcription of HXT4 (but not HXT2 or HXT3) in response
		  to addition of a small amount of glucose to cells, an
		  outcome we observed experimentally. Our model also provides
		  a mechanistic explanation for this result: HXT2-4 are
		  governed by a type 2, incoherent feed forward regulatory
		  loop involving the Rgt1 and Mig2 transcriptional
		  repressors. The efficiency with which Rgt1 and Mig2 repress
		  expression of each HXT gene determines which of them have a

  abstract	= {Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats
		  2 (IFIT2) is one of the most highly responsive
		  interferon-stimulated genes, but its biological functions
		  are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore
		  the underlying mechanisms by which depleting IFIT2 induces
		  the migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells.
		  Stable IFIT2-depleted cells underwent
		  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and exhibited
		  enhanced cell motility and invasiveness compared with
		  control cells. Furthermore, our results indicated that
		  atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) was activated in
		  IFIT2-depleted cells. Inhibition of aPKC using a specific
		  myristoylated PKC$\zeta$ pseudosubstrate or aPKC-targeting
		  small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished IFIT2
		  depletion-induced EMT, migration and invasion, indicating
		  that the activation of aPKC has an essential role in
		  regulating the cellular responses induced by IFIT2
		  depletion. Following tail-vein injection, IFIT2-depleted
		  OSCC cells colonized not only the lungs but also the heart,
		  head and neck, retroperitoneal, and peritoneal cavities;
		  whereas control cells predominantly localized in the lungs.
		  IFIT2 mRNA and protein expression was positively associated
		  with E-cadherin expression in OSCC patient specimens. The
		  loss of E-cadherin and IFIT2 expression was observed at the
		  invasive front of OSCC tumors, suggesting that the loss of
		  IFIT2 may induce EMT and lead to the metastasis of OSCCs.
		  OSCC patients possessing reduced IFIT2-expression levels
		  (IFIT2 {\textless}50{\%}) exhibited greater rates of
		  distant metastasis and poor prognoses compared with OSCC
		  patients who expressed greater levels of IFIT2 (IFIT2
		  ≥50{\%}). These results demonstrate that IFIT2 depletion
		  activates the aPKC pathway and consequently induces EMT,
		  cell migration and invasion. Most importantly, depleting
		  IFIT2 may participate in OSCC tumor progression,
		  particularly during metastasis. Taken together, our study
		  demonstrates that IFIT2, a protein responsible for
		  interferon stimulation, may prevent OSCC metastasis and
		  serve as a valuable prognostic marker.},

		  identify proteins that interact with the
		  carboxyl-cytoplasmic domain (residues 464-509) of the
		  insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 (C-GLUT4).
		  Using as bait C-GLUT4, we have isolated the carboxyl domain
		  of Daxx (C-Daxx), the adaptor protein associated with the
		  Fas and the type II TGF-beta (TbetaRII) receptors (1,2 ).
		  The two-hybrid interaction between C-GLUT4 and C-Daxx is
		  validated by the ability of in vitro translated C-GLUT4 to
		  interact with in vitro translated full-length Daxx and
		  C-Daxx. C-Daxx does not interact with the C-cytoplasmic
		  domain of GLUT1, the ubiquitous glucose transporter
		  homologous to GLUT4. Replacement of alanine and serine for
		  the dileucine pair (Leu(489)-Leu(490)) critical for
		  targeting GLUT4 from the trans-Golgi network to the
		  perinuclear intracellular store as well as for its surface
		  internalization by endocytosis inhibits 2-fold the

		  GLUT4 immunoprecipitated from lysates of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts
		  stably transfected with GLUT4 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes

		  Similarly, GLUT4 is recovered with anti-Daxx

		  studies localize Daxx to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear
		  bodies and punctate cytoplasmic structures, often organized

		  sequestering polypeptide thymosin $\beta$4 frequently is
		  overexpressed in cancers and that such overexpression
		  correlates to malignant progression. However, the
		  localization of thymosin $\beta$4 in human cancers has not
		  been determined. We now demonstrate that there is a
		  considerable heterogeneity in the cellular distribution of
		  thymosin $\beta$4 in breast cancer. In most tumors
		  examined, cancer cells showed low or intermediate
		  reactivity for thymosin $\beta$4, whereas leukocytes and
		  macrophages showed intense reactivity. In addition,
		  endothelial cells showed variable reactivity to thymosin
		  $\beta$4, whereas myofibroblasts were negative. There was
		  no correlation between the intensity of tumor cell staining
		  and histological grade, whereas there was a tendency toward
		  a correlation between endothelial cell staining and grade.
		  These results demonstrate that multiple cell types within
		  the tumor microenvironment produce thymosin $\beta$4 and
		  that such expression varies from tumor to tumor. Such

  abstract	= {In skeletal muscle, both insulin and muscle contractions

		  Despite the fact that skeletal muscle glucose uptake plays
		  a major role in normal conditions, in insulin resistance,
		  and type II diabetes, the details of GLUT4 translocation
		  and the intracellular signalling involved have not been
		  fully described. A main reason is that the majority of
		  experiments have been carried out in muscle cultures in

		  and, therefore, diverges from real muscle, in that it has
		  lower expression of GLUT4, an underdeveloped or nonexistent

		  insulin. Thus, experiments carried out in cultured muscle
		  cell systems might give misleading results on how GLUT4
		  translocation and the signalling involved takes place. To
		  address this problem, a confocal imaging technique has been
		  developed that allows delineation of the spartial and
		  spatial distribution of GFP-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4-GFP)
		  translocation in living muscle fibers in situ in
		  anesthetized mice. The effects of stimuli with insulin or
		  in situ muscle contractions in fully differentiated muscle
		  fibers can now be studied before, during, and after
		  applying stimuli. Initial analysis of insulin-stimulated
		  GLUT4-GFP translocation showed a delay in maximal
		  translocation between the sarcolemma and t-tubules.
		  Corresponding to the delay, we found that fluorescent
		  tagged insulin reaches the sarcolemma first and then, with
		  a delay, diffuses into the t-tubule system, enabling
		  interaction with local insulin receptors and, in turn,
		  triggering local insulin signalling and local GLUT4
		  translocation. In parallel, we showed that the majority of
		  GLUT4 depot vesicles do not move long distances but are
		  depleted locally in the sarcolemma or t-tubule regions.
		  Analysis of GLUT4 translocation in insulin-resistant muscle
		  showed that, primarily, GLUT4 recruitment in the t-tubule
		  region is affected. We have now analysed the kinetics of
		  contraction-mediated GLUT4 translocation and
		  reinternalization, as well as dilineated some of the key
		  signalling points involved in these processes.},

  abstract	= {There is evidence that the atypical protein kinases C
		  (PKC(lambda), PKC(zeta)) participate in signaling from the
		  insulin receptor to cause the translocation of glucose
		  transporters from an intracellular location to the plasma
		  membrane in adipocytes. In order to search for downstream
		  effectors of these PKCs, we identified the proteins that
		  were immunoprecipitated by an antibody against
		  PKC(lambda/zeta) from lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through
		  peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. The data show that
		  PKC(lambda) is the major atypical PKC in these cells.
		  Moreover, an oligomeric complex consisting of alpha- and
		  gamma-adducin, which are cytoskeletal proteins,
		  coimmunoprecipitated with PKC(lambda). Association of the
		  adducins with PKC(lambda) was further indicated by the
		  finding that the adducins coimmunoprecipitated
		  proportionally with PKC(lambda) in repeated rounds of
		  immunoprecipitation. Such an association is consistent with
		  literature reports that the adducins contain a single major
		  site for PKC phosphorylation in their carboxy termini.
		  Using antibody against the phospho form of this site for
		  immunoblotting, we found that insulin caused little or no
		  increase in the phosphorylation of this site on the
		  adducins in a whole cell lysate or on the small portion of
		  the adducins that coimmunoprecipitated with PKC(lambda).
		  PKC(lambda) and the adducins were located in both the
		  cytosol and subcellular membranous fractions. The binding
		  of PKC(lambda) to adducin may function to localize
		  PKC(lambda) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.},

		  Published genome-wide profiling studies of HNSCC3,4 are
		  limited to single platforms. To generate an integrated
		  genomic annotation of molecular alterations in HNSCC, The
		  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has undertaken a comprehensive
		  multi-platform characterization of 500 tumours with the a
		  priori hypothesis of detecting somatic variants present in
		  at least 5{\%} of samples. Here, we report the results for
		  ana- lyses from the first 279 patients with complete data},

  abstract	= {The majority of research on reactive oxygen species (ROS)
		  has focused on their cellular toxicities. Stem cells
		  generally have been thought to maintain low levels of ROS
		  as a protection against these processes. However, recent
		  studies suggest that ROS can also play roles as second
		  messengers, activating normal cellular processes. Here, we
		  investigated ROS function in primary brain-derived neural
		  progenitors. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that
		  proliferative, self-renewing multipotent neural progenitors
		  with the phenotypic characteristics of neural stem cells
		  (NSC) maintained a high ROS status and were highly
		  responsive to ROS stimulation. ROS-mediated enhancements in
		  self-renewal and neurogenesis were dependent on PI3K/Akt
		  signaling. Pharmacological or genetic manipulations that
		  diminished cellular ROS levels also interfered with normal
		  NSC and/or multipotent progenitor function both in vitro
		  and in vivo. This study has identified a redox-mediated
		  regulatory mechanism of NSC function that may have
		  significant implications for brain injury, disease, and
		  repair.},

  abstract	= {Objective: In patients with head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (HNSCC), cetuximab [a monoclonal antibody
		  targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] has been
		  shown to improve overall survival when combined with
		  radiotherapy in the locally advanced setting or with
		  chemotherapy in first-line recurrent and/or metastatic
		  (R/M) setting, respectively. While biomarkers of resistance
		  to cetuximab have been identified in metastatic colorectal
		  cancer, no biomarkers of efficacy have been identified in
		  HNSCC. Here, we aimed to identify biomarkers of cetuximab
		  sensitivity/resistance in HNSCC. Methods: HNSCC patients
		  treated with cetuximab at the Curie Institute, for whom
		  complete clinicopathological data and formalin-fixed
		  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue collected before
		  cetuximab treatment were available, were included.
		  Immunohistochemistry analyses of PTEN and EGFR were
		  performed to assess protein expression levels. PIK3CA and
		  H/N/KRAS mutations were analyzed using high-resolution
		  melting (HRM) and Sanger sequencing. We evaluated the
		  predictive value of these alterations in terms of
		  progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Hot spot
		  activating PIK3CA and KRAS/HRAS mutations were associated
		  with poor PFS among HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab
		  in the first-line R/M setting, but not among HNSCC patients
		  treated with cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy.
		  Loss of PTEN protein expression had a negative predictive
		  value among HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab and
		  radiotherapy. High EGFR expression did not predict
		  cetuximab sensitivity in our patient population.
		  Conclusions: Hot spot activating PIK3CA and RAS mutations
		  predicted cetuximab resistance among HNSCC patients in the
		  first-line R/M setting, whereas loss of PTEN protein
		  expression predicted resistance to cetuximab when combined
		  to radiotherapy.},

  abstract	= {Since radiation-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and
		  ROS generation were partially prevented by HSP25
		  overexpression, similar to the treatment of control cells
		  with antioxidant agents such as DPI and tiron, questions
		  arise whether radiation-mediated ROS generation contributes
		  to the apoptotic cell death, and also whether HSP25
		  overexpression can reduce ROS mediated apoptotic cell
		  death. In the present study, radiation-induced cytochrome c
		  release from mitochondria and activation of caspases
		  accompanied by a decrease of mitochondrial membrane
		  potential in Jurkat T cells were shown to be inhibited by
		  mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, suggesting that
		  mitochondrial ROS might be important in radiation-induced
		  caspase-dependent apoptosis. When HSP25 was overexpressed,
		  effects similar to the treatment of cells with the
		  antioxidants were obtained, indicating that HSP25
		  suppressed radiation-induced mitochondrial alteration that
		  resulted in apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of p38 MAP
		  kinase by radiation was associated with radiation-induced
		  cell death and ROS production and PKCdelta was an upstream
		  molecule for p38 MAP kinase activation, ROS generation and
		  subsequent caspase-dependent apoptotic events. However, in
		  the HSP25 overexpressed cells, the above-described effects
		  were blocked. In fact, radiation-induced membrane
		  translocation of PKCdelta and tyrosine phosphorylation were
		  inhibited by HSP25. Based on the above data, we suggest
		  that HSP25 downregulates PKCdelta, which is a key molecule
		  for radiation-induced ROS generation and

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: Members of paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family have
		  been identified as onconeuronal antigens, which aberrant
		  expressions in cancer cells of patients with paraneoplastic
		  disorder (PND) are closely linked to manifestation of
		  auto-immunity, neuro-degeneration, and cancer. The purpose
		  of present study was to determine the role of PNMA5 and its
		  functional relationship to MOAP-1 (PNMA4) in human cancer
		  cells. METHODS: PNMA5 mutants were generated through
		  deletion or site-directed mutagenesis and transiently
		  expressed in human cancer cell lines to investigate their
		  role in apoptosis, subcellular localization, and potential
		  interaction with MOAP-1 through apoptosis assays,
		  fluorescence microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation
		  studies, respectively. RESULTS: Over-expressed human PNMA5
		  exhibited nuclear localization pattern in both MCF-7 and
		  HeLa cells. Deletion mapping and mutagenesis studies showed
		  that C-terminus of PNMA5 is responsible for nuclear
		  localization, while the amino acid residues (391KRRR)
		  within the C-terminus of PNMA5 are required for nuclear
		  targeting. Deletion mapping and co-immunoprecipitation
		  studies showed that PNMA5 interacts with MOAP-1 and
		  N-terminal domain of PNMA5 is required for interaction with
		  MOAP-1. Furthermore, co-expression of PNMA5 and MOAP-1 in
		  MCF-7 cells significantly enhanced chemo-sensitivity of
		  MCF-7 to Etoposide treatment, indicating that PNMA5 and
		  MOAP-1 interact synergistically to promote apoptotic
		  signaling in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show
		  that PNMA5 promotes apoptosis signaling in HeLa and MCF-7
		  cells and interacts synergistically with MOAP-1 through its
		  N-terminal domain to promote apoptosis and
		  chemo-sensitivity in human cancer cells. The C-terminal
		  domain of PNMA5 is required for nuclear localization;
		  however, both N-and C-terminal domains of PNMA5 appear to
		  be required for pro-apoptotic function.},

		  used to promote revascularization after peripheral or
		  myocardial ischemia, excess amounts of reactive oxygen
		  species (ROS) are often involved in senescence and
		  apoptosis of EPCs, thereby causing defective
		  neovascularization and reduced or failed recovery. Here, we
		  examined the cytoprotective effect of Ecklonia cava-derived
		  antioxidant dieckol (DK) on oxidative stress-induced
		  apoptosis in EPCs to improve EPC bioactivity for vessel
		  repair. Although H2O2 (10 (- 3) M) increased the
		  intracellular ROS level in EPCs, DK (10ug/ml) pretreatment
		  suppressed the H2O2-induced ROS increase and drastically
		  reduced the ratios of apoptotic cells. H2O2-induced ROS
		  increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK; this was
		  inhibited by DK pretreatment. H2O2 treatment increased the
		  phosphorylation of NF-$\kappa$B, which was blocked by
		  pretreatment with SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or SP
		  600125, a JNK inhibitor. H2O2 decreased the cellular levels
		  of Bcl-2 and c-IAPs, cellular inhibitors of apoptosis
		  proteins, but increased caspase-3 activation. However, all
		  these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with DK.
		  Injection of DK-mixed EPCs (DK + EPCs) into myocardial
		  ischemic sites in vivo induced cellular proliferation and
		  survival of cells at the ischemic sites and, thereby,
		  enhanced the secretion of angiogenic cytokines at the
		  ischemic sites. These results show that DK + EPC exhibit
		  markedly enhanced anti-apoptotic and antioxidative
		  capabilities, unlike that shown by EPCs alone; thus, they
		  contribute to improved repair of ischemic myocardial injury

		  conducted a retrospective study with 4,458 patients with an
		  index tumour located in the head and neck diagnosed during
		  the 1985-2016 period. We evaluated the incidence of
		  appearance of second neoplasms and successive neoplasms

		  1,203 patients (27.0{\%}) had a second neoplasm, 242
		  patients (5.4{\%}) a third neoplasm, 58 patients (1.3{\%})
		  a fourth neoplasm, and 8 patients (0.2{\%}) 5 or more

		  a second neoplasm had a higher risk of appearance of a
		  third neoplasm, and those with a third neoplasm had a
		  higher risk of a fourth. Seventy-eight percent of the
		  second neoplasms, 88{\%} of the third neoplasms, and

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cancer cells require increased nutrient
		  uptake to support a high rate of proliferation, and the
		  overexpression of glucose transporters, in particular
		  GLUT1, is a common characteristic of human malignancies.
		  Here, we investigated the relationship between the
		  expression of GLUT1 and cell viability, colony forming
		  ability and apoptosis of head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (HNSCC) in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model
		  in vivo.
		  
		  METHODS: Lentiviral mediated overexpression and knock-down
		  of GLUT1 was performed in two oral cancer cell lines (CAL27
		  and SCC25). QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to
		  detect the mRNA and protein expression of GLUT1 and nuclear
		  factor-kappa B (NF$\kappa$B) p65 subunit. Cell viability
		  and apoptosis were assessed by MTT and flow cytometry
		  analyses, respectively. Colony formation assays were
		  performed by staining with 0.5{\%} crystal violet. The role
		  of GLUT1 in HNSCC was examined in vivo through the
		  generation of a CAL27 (or CAL27 with different
		  transfections) nude mice xenograft model of HNSCC.
		  
		  RESULTS: GLUT1 overexpression promoted cell viability and
		  colony formation whereas GLUT1 silencing had the opposite
		  effect. GLUT1 knock-down significantly increased the number
		  of Annexin V positive cells in both cell lines and GLUT1
		  overexpression had the opposite effect, indicating that
		  GLUT1 modulates apoptosis. Xenograft mouse models of GLUT1
		  knockdown and overexpression showed that GLUT1 expression
		  was associated with poor survival and increased tumor
		  growth. GLUT1 overexpression significantly upregulated the
		  expression of NF$\kappa$B-p65, and this effect was reversed
		  by inhibition of GLUT1 expression.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: GLUT1 expression plays an important role in
		  the survival of HNSCC, and its effects may be associated
		  with the activation of the NF$\kappa$B pathway.},

		  provides more biological data to design preclinical
		  studies. We and others previously reported whole exome
		  sequencing data of 106 HNSCC primary tumors. In 2012, high
		  throughput genomic data and pharmacological profiling of
		  anticancer drugs of hundreds of cancer cell lines were
		  reported. Here we compared the genomic data of 39 HNSCC
		  cell lines with the genomic findings in 106 HNSCC tumors.
		  Amplification of eight genes (PIK3CA, EGFR, CCND2, KDM5A,
		  ERBB2, PMS1, FGFR1 and WHSCIL1) and deletion of five genes
		  (CDKN2A, SMAD4, NOTCH2, NRAS and TRIM33) were found in both
		  HNSCC cell lines and tumors. Seventeen genes were only
		  mutated in HNSCC cell lines ({\textgreater}10{\%})
		  suggesting that these mutations may arise through
		  immortalization in tissue culture. Conversely, 11 genes
		  were only mutated in {\textgreater}10{\%} of human HNSCC
		  tumors. Several mutant genes in the EGFR pathway are shared
		  both in cell lines and in tumors. Pharmacological profiling
		  of eight anticancer agents in six HNSCC cell lines

  abstract	= {IMPORTANCE The prevalence of early-stage non–small cell
		  lung cancer (NSCLC) is expected to increase with recent
		  implementation of annual screening programs. Reliable
		  prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at a
		  high risk for recurrence to guide adjuvant therapy.
		  OBJECTIVE To develop a robust, individualized immune
		  signature that can estimate prognosis in patients with
		  early-stage nonsquamous NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
		  PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study analyzed the gene
		  expression profiles of frozen tumor tissue samples from 19
		  public NSCLC cohorts, including 18 microarray data sets and
		  1 RNA-Seq data set for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung
		  adenocarcinoma cohort. Only patients with nonsquamous NSCLC
		  with clinical annotation were included. Samples were from
		  2414 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, divided into a
		  meta-training cohort (729 patients), meta-testing cohort
		  (716 patients), and 3 independent validation cohorts (439,
		  323, and 207 patients). All patients underwent surgery with
		  a negative surgical margin, received no adjuvant or
		  neoadjuvant therapy, and had publicly available gene
		  expression data and survival information. Data were
		  collected from July 22 through September 8, 2016. MAIN
		  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival. RESULTS Of 2414
		  patients (1205 men [50{\%}], 1111 women [46{\%}], and 98 of
		  unknown sex [4{\%}]; median age [range], 64 [15-90] years),
		  a prognostic immune signature of 25 gene pairs consisting
		  of 40 unique genes was constructed using the meta-training
		  data set. In the meta-testing and validation cohorts, the
		  immune signature significantly stratified patients into
		  high-vs low-risk groups in terms of overall survival across
		  and within subpopulations with stage I, IA, IB, or II
		  disease and remained as an independent prognostic factor in
		  multivariate analyses (hazard ratio range, 1.72 [95{\%} CI,
		  1.26-2.33; P {\textless} .001] to 2.36 [95{\%} CI,
		  1.47-3.79; P {\textless} .001]) after adjusting for
		  clinical and pathologic factors. Several biological
		  processes, including chemotaxis, were enriched among genes
		  in the immune signature. The percentage of neutrophil
		  infiltration (5.6{\%} vs 1.8{\%}) and necrosis (4.6{\%} vs
		  1.5{\%}) was significantly higher in the high-risk immune
		  group compared with the low-risk groups in TCGA data set (P
		  {\textless} .003). The immune signature achieved a higher
		  accuracy (mean concordance index [C-index], 0.64) than 2
		  commercialized multigene signatures (mean C-index, 0.53 and
		  0.61) for estimation of survival in comparable validation
		  cohorts. When integrated with clinical characteristics such
		  as age and stage, the composite clinical and immune
		  signature showed improved prognostic accuracy in all
		  validation data sets relative to molecular signatures alone
		  (mean C-index, 0.70 vs 0.63) and another commercialized
		  clinical-molecular signature (mean C-index, 0.68 vs 0.65).
		  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The proposed clinical-immune
		  signature is a promising biomarker for estimating overall
		  survival in nonsquamous NSCLC, including early-stage
		  disease. Prospective studies are needed to test the
		  clinical utility of the biomarker in individualized
		  management of nonsquamous NSCLC.},

		  of miR-182-5p in OSCC by targeting the
		  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor
		  CAMK2N1. Methods: miR-182-5p expression was quantified in
		  OSCC tissues and cell lines with reverse transcription
		  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell colony formation,
		  Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Ki-67, and nude mouse
		  xenograft assays were used to characterize the role of
		  miR-182-5p in the proliferation of OSCC. A miR-182-5p
		  target gene was identified with western blotting, RT-PCR,
		  and luciferase activity assays. OSCC patient survival based
		  on CAMK2N1 expression was also analyzed. Results:
		  miR-182-5p was up-regulated in in vitro cell lines and in
		  vivo clinical OSCC samples. CCK-8, colony formation, and
		  Ki-67 assays revealed that miR-182-5p promoted the growth

  abstract	= {Cancer-causing herpesviruses infect nearly every human and
		  persist indefinitely in B lymphocytes in a quiescent state
		  known as latency. A hallmark of this quiescence or latency
		  is the presence of extrachromosomal viral genomes with
		  highly restricted expression of viral genes. Silencing of
		  viral genes ensures both immune evasion by the virus and
		  limited pathology to the host, yet how multiple genes on
		  multiple copies of viral genomes are simultaneously
		  silenced is a mystery. In a unifying theme, we report that
		  both cancer-causing human herpesviruses, despite having
		  evolved independently, are silenced through the activities
		  of two members of the Kr{\"{u}}ppel-associated box (KRAB)
		  domain–zinc finger protein (ZFP) (KRAB-ZFP) epigenetic
		  silencing family, revealing a novel STAT3-KRAB-ZFP axis of
		  virus latency. This dual-edged antiviral strategy restricts
		  the destructive ability of the lytic phase while promoting
		  the cancer-causing latent phase. These findings also unveil
		  roles for KRAB-ZFPs in silencing of multicopy foreign
		  genomes with the promise of evicting herpesviruses to kill
		  viral cancers bearing clonal viral episomes. IMPORTANCE
		  Despite robust immune responses, cancer-causing viruses
		  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
		  herpesvirus (KSHV) persist for life. This persistence is
		  accomplished partly through a stealth mechanism that keeps
		  extrachromosomal viral genomes quiescent. Quiescence, or
		  latency, ensures that not every cell harboring viral
		  genomes is killed directly through lytic activation or
		  indirectly via the immune response, thereby evicting virus
		  from host. For the host, quiescence limits pathology. Thus,
		  both virus and host benefit from quiescence, yet how
		  quiescence is maintained through silencing of a large set
		  of viral genes on multiple viral genomes is not well
		  understood. Our studies reveal that members of a
		  gene-silencing family, the KRAB-ZFPs, promote quiescence of
		  both cancer-causing human viruses through simultaneous
		  silencing of multiple genes on multicopy extrachromosomal

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: Extracapsular spread (ECS) to the cervical lymph
		  nodes is a major adverse prognostic factor in oral cavity
		  squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We prospectively examined
		  the value of FDG PET immediately before postoperative
		  radiotherapy/concurrent chemoradiotherapy (pre-RT/CCRT PET)
		  to detect residual/relapsing disease in the early
		  postsurgical follow-up period in high-risk OSCC patients
		  with ECS.
		  
		  METHODS: We examined 183 high-risk OSCC patients with ECS
		  who underwent preoperative FDG PET/CT for staging purposes.
		  Of these patients, 29 underwent a second pre-RT/CCRT FDG
		  PET/CT scan. The clinical utility of the second FDG PET/CT
		  was examined using Kaplan-Meier curve analysis.
		  
		  RESULTS: Patients who underwent the second FDG PET/CT scan
		  had baseline clinicopathological characteristics similar to
		  those who did not undergo a second scan. Of the patients
		  who underwent the second scan, seven (24 {\%}) had
		  unexpected, newly discovered lesions. Five eventually died
		  of the disease, and two had no evidence of recurrence after
		  a change in RT field and dose. In an event-based analysis
		  at 2 months, rates of neck control (6/29 vs. 6/154, p =
		  0.001), distant metastases (3/29 vs. 4/154, p = 0.046), and
		  disease-free survival (7/29 vs. 10/154, p = 0.003) were
		  significantly higher in patients who received a second PET
		  scan than in those who did not. The second pre-RT/CCRT PET
		  scan was of particular benefit for detecting new lesions in
		  OSCC patients with both ECS and lymph node standardized
		  uptake value (SUV) of ≥ 5.2 in the first PET scan.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: The present findings support the clinical value
		  of pre-RT/CCRT FDG PET for defining treatment strategy in
		  OSCC patients with both ECS and high nodal SUV, even when
		  FDG PET had already been performed during the initial
		  staging work-up.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
		  is an aggressive and lethal malignancy. Publically
		  available cell lines are mostly of lingual origin, or have
		  not been carefully characterized. Detailed characterization
		  of novel HNSCC cell lines is needed in order to provide
		  researchers a concrete keystone on which to build their
		  investigations.
		  
		  METHODS: The USC-HN1 cell line was established from a
		  primary maxillary HNSCC biopsy explant in tissue culture.
		  The immortalized cells were then further characterized by
		  heterotransplantation in Nude mice; immunohistochemical
		  staining for relevant HNSCC biomarkers; flow cytometry for
		  surface markers; cytogenetic karyotypic analysis; human
		  papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus screening; qRT-PCR
		  for oncogene and cytokine analysis; investigation of
		  activated, cleaved Notch1 levels; and detailed 35,000 gene
		  microarray analysis.
		  
		  RESULTS: Characterization experiments confirmed the human
		  HNSCC origin of USC-HN1, including a phenotype similar to
		  the original tumor. Viral screening revealed no HPV or EBV
		  infection, while western blotting displayed significant
		  upregulation of activated, cleaved Notch1.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: USC-HN1, a novel immortalized cell line has
		  been derived from a maxillary HNSCC. Characterization
		  studies have shown that the cell line is of HNSCC origin
		  and displays many of the same markers previously reported
		  in the literature. USC-HN1 is available for public research
		  and will further the investigation of HNSCC and the
		  development of new therapeutic modalities.},

  abstract	= {The functioning and survival of mammalian cells requires
		  an active energy metabolism. Metabolic dysfunction plays an
		  important role in many human diseases, including diabetes,
		  cancer, inherited mitochondrial disorders, and metabolic
		  syndrome. The monosaccharide glucose constitutes a key
		  source of cellular energy. Following its import across the
		  plasma membrane, glucose is converted into pyruvate by the
		  glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate oxidation supplies substrates
		  for the ATP-generating mitochondrial oxidative
		  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. To gain cell-biochemical
		  knowledge about the operation and regulation of the
		  cellular energy metabolism in the healthy and diseased
		  state, quantitative knowledge is required about (changes
		  in) metabolite concentrations under (non) steady-state
		  conditions. This information can, for instance, be used to
		  construct more realistic in silico models of cell
		  metabolism, which facilitates understanding the
		  consequences of metabolic dysfunction as well as on- and
		  off-target effects of mitochondrial drugs. Here we review
		  the current state-of-the-art live-cell quantification of
		  two key cellular metabolites, glucose and ATP, using
		  protein-based sensors. The latter apply the principle of
		  FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) and allow

		  carcinoma before and after 2002 were compared. Methods Two
		  hundred forty-five patients with buccal cancer who
		  underwent curative treatment were retrospectively reviewed.
		  Results The 5-year overall survival rate was 30.0{\%}
		  before 2002 and 53.5{\%} after 2002 (p =.004). On
		  multivariate analysis, T classification, surgical margins,
		  and treatment modality significantly affected overall

		  trends to affect it. Invasion depth had a trend to
		  influence locoregional control. For patients with
		  early-stage disease without adverse factors, the
		  locoregional control was similar between surgery alone
		  group and surgery + radiotherapy group. Conclusion The
		  survival of patients with buccal cancer was improved after
		  2002, which represented the start of intensity-modulated
		  radiotherapy (IMRT) in our institute. Ipsilateral neck
		  alone irradiation was recommended for T1-2N0-1 and small

		  investigate the role of tumor volume in the prognosis of
		  patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
		  METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients with T4a oral
		  cavity SCCs underwent surgical treatment. The volumes of
		  the primary cancer were calculated by the multiplication of
		  3 macroscopic dimensions of the surgical specimen and
		  related to recurrence and death. RESULTS: There were 54
		  recurrences (43.9{\%}) and 75 deaths (60.9{\%}). The mean
		  tumor volume among the patients living without disease
		  during the follow-up period was 28.2 cc, compared to 88.2
		  cc for patients living with disease, and to 78.9 cc for
		  patients who died of the disease (p {\textless} .001).
		  Multivariate analyses showed that volume and perineural
		  invasion were independent factors for recurrence, whereas
		  volume and lymph node metastasis were independent factors
		  for death. CONCLUSION: Among patients who already have
		  advanced cancers, tumor volume can significantly impact

  abstract	= {To identify novel regulatory components involved in the
		  recycling of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter
		  GLUT4, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate
		  GLUT4-binding proteins from a rat adipose cell cDNA
		  library. We found a 49-kDa protein (p49/STRAP) that
		  specifically interacts with an acidic amino acid motif
		  (Q7IGSEDG) in the N-terminus of GLUT4. Confocal
		  immunofluorescence microscopy of primary rat adipose cells
		  shows co-localization of myc-p49 with GLUT4 and also with
		  the ER-resident protein calnexin. Insulin stimulation had
		  no effect on GLUT4-binding and subcellular distribution of
		  p49 in adipose cells. However, overexpression of the
		  GLUT4-binding domain of p49 in adipose cells reduces
		  protein synthesis and cell-surface expression of GLUT4, but
		  not of GLUT8. Moreover, cell-surface expression of a
		  p49-binding-deficient GLUT4 mutant (ED/QN) is also reduced.
		  Kinetic analysis of HA-epitope-tagged GLUT4 protein

  abstract	= {A new molecular mathematical model is developed by
		  considering the kinetics of GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT4, the
		  process of glucose mobilization by glycogen phosphorylase
		  and glycogen synthase in liver, and the dynamics of the
		  insulin signaling pathway. The new model can qualitatively
		  reproduce the experimental glucose and insulin data. It
		  also enables us to use the Bendixson criterion about the
		  existence of periodic orbits of a two-dimensional dynamical
		  system to mathematically predict that the oscillations of
		  glucose and insulin are not caused by liver, instead they
		  would be caused by the mechanism of insulin secretion from
		  pancreatic beta cells. Furthermore it enables us to conduct
		  a parametric sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that
		  both glucose and insulin are most sensitive to the rate
		  constant for conversion of PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(4,5)P(2),
		  the multiplicative factor modulating the rate constant for
		  conversion of PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(4,5)P(2), the
		  multiplicative factor that modulates insulin receptor
		  dephosphorylation rate, and the maximum velocity of GLUT4.
		  Moreover, the sensitivity analysis predicts that an
		  increase of the apparent velocity of GLUT4, a combination
		  of elevated mobilization rate of GLUT4 to the plasma
		  membrane and an extended duration of GLUT4 on the plasma
		  membrane, will result in a decrease in the needs of plasma
		  insulin. On the other hand, an increase of the GLUT4
		  internalization rate results in an elevated demand of
		  insulin to stimulate the mobilization of GLUT4 from the

  abstract	= {We demonstrate that a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632), in
		  combination with fibroblast feeder cells, induces normal
		  and tumor epithelial cells from many tissues to proliferate
		  indefinitely in vitro, without transduction of exogenous
		  viral or cellular genes. Primary prostate and mammary
		  cells, for example, are reprogrammed toward a basaloid,
		  stem-like phenotype and form well-organized prostaspheres
		  and mammospheres in Matrigel. However, in contrast to the
		  selection of rare stem-like cells, the described growth
		  conditions can generate 2 × 10(6) cells in 5 to 6 days
		  from needle biopsies, and can generate cultures from
		  cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells.
		  Continued cell proliferation is dependent on both feeder
		  cells and Y-27632, and the conditionally reprogrammed cells
		  (CRCs) retain a normal karyotype and remain nontumorigenic.
		  This technique also efficiently establishes cell cultures
		  from human and rodent tumors. For example, CRCs established
		  from human prostate adenocarcinoma displayed instability of
		  chromosome 13, proliferated abnormally in Matrigel, and
		  formed tumors in mice with severe combined
		  immunodeficiency. The ability to rapidly generate many
		  tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue
		  provides significant opportunities for cell-based
		  diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity
		  testing) and greatly expands the value of biobanking. In
		  addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic

  abstract	= {The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg
		  effect is increasingly recognized, and glycolysis has
		  become a target of anticancer strategies. We recently
		  reported the identification of a group of novel small
		  compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce
		  cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism.
		  We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are
		  efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents. Here, we report
		  that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only
		  inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also
		  inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model. Daily
		  intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in
		  a more than 70{\%} reduction in the size of human lung
		  cancer of A549 cell origin. Mechanism studies showed that
		  WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells
		  (RBC), which express Glut1 as their sole glucose
		  transporter. Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to
		  decreases in levels of Glut1 protein, intracellular ATP,
		  and glycolytic enzymes. All these changes were followed by
		  increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase
		  (AMPK) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated
		  retinoblastoma, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence,
		  and necrosis. Addition of extracellular ATP rescued
		  compound-treated cancer cells, suggesting that the
		  reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in
		  the anticancer mechanism of the molecule. Senescence
		  induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for
		  the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells.
		  Thus, WZB117 is a prototype for further development of
		  anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose
		  transport and glucose metabolism.},

  abstract	= {The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg
		  effect is increasingly recognized, and glycolysis has
		  become a target of anticancer strategies. We recently
		  reported the identification of a group of novel small
		  compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce
		  cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism.
		  We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are
		  efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents. Here, we report
		  that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only
		  inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also
		  inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model. Daily
		  intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in
		  a more than 70{\%} reduction in the size of human lung
		  cancer of A549 cell origin. Mechanism studies showed that
		  WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells
		  (RBC), which express Glut1 as their sole glucose
		  transporter. Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to
		  decreases in levels of Glut1 protein, intracellular ATP,
		  and glycolytic enzymes. All these changes were followed by
		  increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase
		  (AMPK) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated
		  retinoblastoma, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence,
		  and necrosis. Addition of extracellular ATP rescued
		  compound-treated cancer cells, suggesting that the
		  reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in
		  the anticancer mechanism of the molecule. Senescence
		  induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for
		  the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells.
		  Thus, WZB117 is a prototype for further development of
		  anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose
		  transport and glucose metabolism.},

		  CD133(+) cells, to induce DNA damage responses, and to
		  upregulate ABCG2 and ABCB1 expression, which therefore
		  increased the cross-resistance to doxorubicin and
		  paclitaxel. This cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133(+)
		  cells was mediated through Notch signaling as judged by

		  elicits many undesired side effects. The purpose of this
		  study was to investigate whether the low-dose deguelin can
		  prevent the metastasis of oral cancer.
		  
		  METHODS: The dose effects of deguelin on metastasis of oral
		  cancer cells were analyzed by in vitro invasion assay and
		  an orthotropic xenograft mouse model. The involvement of
		  TNF-$\alpha$-induced NF-$\kappa$B signaling was examined by

		  RESULTS: Low-dose deguelin, which has minimal cytotoxicity,
		  significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of oral
		  cancer cells. These inhibitory effects of low-dose deguelin
		  were mediated by suppressing TNF-$\alpha$-induced
		  activation of IkB kinase leading to the inhibition of
		  I$\kappa$B phosphorylation, NF-$\kappa$B transcriptional
		  activity and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. The
		  low-dose deguelin treatment significantly inhibited tumor

		  aimed to identify oncogenic lncRNAs that significantly
		  affect the development of esophageal squamous cell
		  carcinoma (ESCC) and investigate the metabolism-related
		  mechanisms.Methods Bioinformatics analysis and siRNA
		  library screening were used to pinpoint lncRNAs that
		  significantly affected cell glycolysis and proliferation.
		  RNAScope(R) in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR assays were
		  performed in clinical samples to investigate expression
		  levels and clinical relevance of the lncRNA. RNA
		  interference and CRISPR-Cas9 were used to explore the
		  functional roles of the lncRNA. In vivo, cell-based and
		  patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were used.
		  Extracellular acidification rate and 13C-labeled
		  intracellular metabolites were determined. RNA pull-down,
		  MS2-Tagged RNA affinity purification, RNA-binding protein
		  immunoprecipitation and cross-linking immunoprecipitation
		  were performed to identify lncRNA associated proteins and
		  related mechanisms.Results The lncRNA LOC148709 was
		  identified as a metabolism-related lncRNA. Increased
		  expression of LOC148709 was observed in ESCC and was
		  correlated with poor prognosis. LOC148709 knockdown
		  significantly decreased cell proliferation and glycolysis.
		  Mechanistically, LOC148709 was directly associated with
		  PFKFB3 and significantly affected PFKFB3 stability.
		  LOC148709 interacted mainly with the C-terminal fragment of
		  PFKFB3 and the T5 (2031–2321) fragment of LOC148709
		  mediated the interaction with PFKFB3. Through inhibiting
		  K302 ubiquitination, LOC148709 protected PFKFB3 from
		  proteasomal degradation, which subsequently activated
		  glycolytic flux and promoted cell cycle progression by
		  regulating p27 and CDK1. P53 could bind to the LOC148709
		  promoter and repress its transcription, p53 loss or
		  mutation triggered striking LOC148709 upregulation.
		  Multiple micro-environmental factors, including hypoxia and
		  oncogenic stress, were also involved in the LOC148709
		  regulatory network via affecting the status of p53.
		  Notably, our patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model studies
		  demonstrated that LOC148709 knockdown dramatically impaired

		  essential role in glycolytic reprogramming by binding to
		  and stabilizing PFKFB3. This study identified a novel
		  metabolism-related lncRNA and revealed a novel mechanism

  annote	= {Key Points Natural killer (NK) cells have the ability to
		  lyse tumour cells without the requirement for prior immune
		  sensitization of the host. NK-cell recognition of target
		  cells is tightly regulated by processes involving the
		  integration of signals delivered from multiple activating
		  and inhibitory receptors. Insights into the molecular
		  specificities that regulate NK-cell function have led to
		  new possibilities to design NK-cell-based immunotherapeutic
		  strategies against human cancer. Strategies of NK-cell
		  immunotherapy include activation of endogenous NK cells,
		  NK-cell-mediated graft-versus-tumour (GVT) effects in the
		  context of haematopoietic allogeneic stem-cell
		  transplantation (SCT), and adoptive transfer of allogeneic
		  NK cells. Endogenous NK cells may be activated by
		  cytokines, immunomodulatory drugs, and agonists of
		  activating receptors or by blockade of inhibitory
		  killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) with
		  monoclonal antibodies, thereby augmenting tumour-cell
		  recognition by NK cells. NK cells may also be genetically
		  engineered to shift the balance towards NK-cell activation.
		  NK cells have been shown to mediate GVT effects in
		  allogeneic haematopoietic SCT. Future criteria for donor
		  selection may involve the selection of
		  KIR–ligand-mismatched donors with a large alloreactive
		  NK-cell subset. Conditioning regimens will probably be
		  required for survival and in vivo expansion of adoptively
		  transferred NK cells. Apart from preventing rejection, such

  abstract	= {Background: Oral cancer is a worldwide problem. It is a
		  universal aggressive disease in the population of smoking
		  and drinking. The oral cancer mortality has been ranked 5th
		  place in Taiwan in male cancer patients. A number of
		  protein markers for oral cancer are still not applicable in
		  large populations. Proteomic technologies provide excellent
		  tools for rapid screening of a large number of potential
		  biomarkers in malignant cells. Method: Proteomics and
		  real-time quantitative RT-PCR were used to analyze
		  over-expressed proteins in 10 OSCC patients. Result:
		  Forty-one proteins were identified as commonly
		  over-expressed in OSCC tissues. In OSCC tissues,
		  $\alpha$B-crystallin, tropomyosin 2, myosin light chain 1,
		  heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), stratifin,
		  thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, flavin reductase,
		  vimentin, rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (rho GDI-2),
		  glutathione S-transferase Pi (GST-pi) and superoxide
		  dismutase [Mn] (MnSOD) were significantly over-expressed
		  (an average of 7.2, 6.0, 5.7, 4.3, 3.6, 3.4, 3.0, 3.0, 2.6,
		  2.5, 2.1-fold, respectively). In real-time quantitative
		  RT-PCR analysis, the gene expressions of
		  $\alpha$B-crystallin, HSP27 and MnSOD were also increased
		  in the cancer tissues, consistent with proteomic results.
		  Conclusion: The identified proteins in this experiment may
		  be used in future studies of carcinogenesis or as
		  diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for OSCC.

  abstract	= {Purpose: To identify a prognostic gene signature for
		  patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)- negative oral
		  squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Experimental Design: Two
		  gene expression datasets were used: a training dataset from
		  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC, Seattle,
		  WA; n = 97) and a validation dataset from the MD Anderson
		  Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX; n = 71). We applied
		  L1/L2-penalized Cox regression models to the FHCRC data on
		  the 131-gene signature previously identified to be
		  prognostic in patients with OSCCs to identify a prognostic
		  model specific for patients with high-risk HPV-negative
		  OSCCs. The models were tested with the MDACC dataset using
		  a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
		  Results: A 13-gene model was identified as the best
		  predictor of HPV-negative OSCC-specific survival in the
		  training dataset. The risk score for each patient in the
		  validation dataset was calculated from this model and
		  dichotomized at the median. The estimated 2-year mortality
		  (±SE) of patients with high-risk scores was 47.1{\%}
		  (±9.24{\%}) compared with 6.35{\%} (±4.42) for patients
		  with low-risk scores. ROC analyses showed that the areas
		  under the curve for the age, gender, and treatment
		  modality-adjusted models with risk score [0.78; 95{\%}
		  confidence interval (CI), 0.74-0.86] and risk score plus

		  higher than for the model with tumor stage (0.54; 95{\%}
		  CI, 0.48-0.62). Conclusions: We identified and validated a
		  13-gene signature that is considerably better than tumor

		  mucocutaneous disease of uncertain aetiology. OLP has many
		  manifestations: reticular, erosive, atrophic, plaque like,
		  papular, bullous, with unique etiopathogenetic working. The
		  purpose of this study is to find a link between different
		  clinical types of lichen and the alterations of lymphocytes
		  on peripheral blood and oral mucosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		  A total of 21 patients were enrolled in this study. The
		  mean age of patients was 53.82 years, between 31 and
		  78 years. OLP Diagnosis was afterwards confirmed by
		  histopathology. Selected patients underwent to clinical
		  evaluation, lesion characterization, incisional biopsy,
		  samples histological analysis, peripheral blood collection.
		  Blood specimens were submitted to cell count determination
		  with differential, characterization of populations and
		  circulating lymphocyte subpopulations using monoclonal
		  antibodies in flow cytometry. Referring to the clinical
		  presentation of lesions, patients were divided in two
		  groups: red lesions (RL) and white lesions (WL) and
		  compared with an age-matched control group. RESULTS: The
		  results of the immunophenotypic study showed correlation
		  between WL and the expression of CD19 lymphocytes
		  (r = 0.693, P = 0.0005). The results of
		  immunohistochemical study performed on histological
		  specimens showed a significant correlation between RL group
		  and expression of all lymphocyte tested (CD3 r = 0.722

		  r = 0.513 P = 0.0173, CD8 r = 0.548 P = 0.0102).
		  CONCLUSIONS: We assume there is the responsibility of the
		  expression of lymphocytes, not only type but also as
		  quantity, in determining RL or WL manifestation of OLP.
		  Circulating lymphocytes may have a role, too.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Cell adhesion has been shown to induce
		  activation of certain growth factor receptors in a
		  ligand-independent manner. However, the mechanism for such
		  activation remains obscure.
		  
		  METHODS: Human epidermal carcinoma A431 cells were used as
		  a model to examine the mechanism for adhesion-induced
		  activation of hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met and
		  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The cells were
		  suspended and replated on culture dishes under various
		  conditions. The phosphorylation of Met at Y1234/1235 and
		  EGFR at Y1173 were used as indicators for their activation.
		  The distribution of the receptors and lipid rafts on the
		  plasma membrane were visualized by confocal fluorescent
		  microscopy and total internal reflection microscopy.
		  
		  RESULTS: We demonstrate that Met and EGFR are
		  constitutively activated in A431 cells, which confers
		  proliferative and invasive potentials to the cells. The
		  ligand-independent activation of Met and EGFR in A431 cells
		  relies on cell adhesion to a substratum, but is independent
		  of cell spreading, extracellular matrix proteins, and
		  substratum stiffness. This adhesion-induced activation of
		  Met and EGFR cannot be attributed to Src activation,
		  production of reactive oxygen species, and the integrity of
		  the cytoskeleton. In addition, we demonstrate that Met and
		  EGFR are independently activated upon cell adhesion.
		  However, partial depletion of Met and EGFR prevents their
		  activation upon cell adhesion, suggesting that
		  overexpression of the receptors is a prerequisite for their
		  self-activation upon cell adhesion. Although Met and EGFR
		  are largely distributed in 0.04{\%} Triton-insoluble
		  fractions (i.e. raft fraction), their activated forms are
		  detected mainly in 0.04{\%} Triton-soluble fractions (i.e.
		  non-raft fraction). Upon cell adhesion, lipid rafts are
		  accumulated at the cell surface close to the
		  cell-substratum interface, while Met and EGFR are mostly
		  excluded from the membrane enriched by lipid rafts.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest for the first time that
		  cell adhesion to a substratum may induce a polarized
		  distribution of lipid rafts to the cell-substratum
		  interface, which may allow Met and EGFR to be released from
		  lipid rafts, thus leading to their activation in a
		  ligand-independent manner.},

@Article{	  lu2014,
  abstract	= {Compared to normal cells, cancer cells strongly upregulate
		  glucose uptake and glycolysis to give rise to increased
		  yield of intermediate glycolytic metabolites and the end
		  product pyruvate. Moreover, glycolysis is uncoupled from
		  the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
		  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer cells.
		  Consequently, the majority of glycolysis-derived pyruvate
		  is diverted to lactate fermentation and kept away from
		  mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. This metabolic
		  phenotype is known as the Warburg effect. While it has
		  become widely accepted that the glycolytic intermediates
		  provide essential anabolic support for cell proliferation
		  and tumor growth, it remains largely elusive whether and
		  how the Warburg metabolic phenotype may play a role in
		  tumor progression. We hereby review the cause and
		  consequence of the restrained oxidative metabolism, in
		  particular in the context of tumor metastasis. Cells change
		  or lose their extracellular matrix during the metastatic
		  process. Inadequate/inappropriate matrix attachment
		  generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes a
		  specific type of cell death, termed anoikis, in normal
		  cells. Although anoikis is a barrier to metastasis, cancer
		  cells have often acquired elevated threshold for anoikis
		  and hence heightened metastatic potential. As ROS are
		  inherent byproducts of oxidative metabolism, forced
		  stimulation of glucose oxidation in cancer cells raises
		  oxidative stress and restores cells' sensitivity to
		  anoikis. Therefore, by limiting the pyruvate flux into
		  mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, the Warburg effect
		  enables cancer cells to avoid excess ROS generation from
		  mitochondrial respiration and thus gain increased anoikis
		  resistance and survival advantage for metastasis.
		  Consistent with this notion, pro-metastatic transcription
		  factors HIF and Snail attenuate oxidative metabolism,
		  whereas tumor suppressor p53 and metastasis suppressor
		  KISS1 promote mitochondrial oxidation. Collectively, these
		  findings reveal mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as a
		  critical suppressor of metastasis and justify metabolic
		  therapies for potential prevention/intervention of tumor
		  metastasis.},

@Article{	  luo2009,
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used
		  strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway
		  knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of related genes and has
		  established major advantages over individual gene analyses,
		  including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological
		  relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage
		  as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or
		  experimental designs. RESULTS: To address these
		  limitations, we present a new GSA method called Generally
		  Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully
		  apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different
		  sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling
		  techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results when
		  compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and
		  PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement in the following
		  three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated
		  studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3)
		  biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms
		  inferred.GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory
		  mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished
		  microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data
		  sets, GAGE derived a more cohesive and predictive
		  mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and
		  metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6 study, GAGE
		  predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced
		  osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF
		  beta signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and
		  estrogen signaling pathways-all of which are supported by
		  the experimental literature. CONCLUSION: GAGE is generally
		  applicable to gene expression datasets with different
		  sample sizes and experimental designs. GAGE consistently
		  outperformed two most frequently used GSA methods and
		  inferred statistically and biologically more relevant
		  regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented in R in
		  the "gage" package, available under the GNU GPL from
		  http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/{\~{}}luow/downloads.php.},

		  elimination during malignant transformation and
		  progression. Here, we provide evidence for the role of the

		  membranous expression of PD-L1 in the tonsillar crypts, the

		  Significant levels of mRNA for IFN-$\gamma$, a major

		  neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains largely
		  unknown. This study sought to research the direct target of
		  miR-381 in HNSCC and investigate their roles in cancer
		  progression. Methods: miRNA and mRNA expression files of
		  HNSCC were accessed from TCGA database and then processed
		  for differential analysis. Bioinformatics databases were
		  employed to predict the target mRNAs of the potential
		  miRNA. qRT-PCR was conducted to determine the expression
		  levels of the target miRNA and mRNA. Then, a series of in
		  vitro experiments like CCK-8, colony formation assay, wound
		  healing assay and transwell assay were performed to detect
		  cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Dual-luciferase
		  reporter gene assay was carried out for the further
		  validation of the targeted relationship between the miRNA
		  and mRNA. Results: miR-381 was observed to be greatly
		  down-regulated in HNSCC cells, and its overexpression could
		  inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
		  Besides, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that
		  STC2 was a direct target of miR-381, and their expression
		  levels were reversely correlated. Moreover, rescue
		  experiments demon-strated that overexpressing STC2 could
		  rescue the inhibitory effect of miR-381 overexpres-sion on
		  cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Also, we
		  verified that miR-381/STC2 exerted its function on HNSCC
		  proliferation by mediating the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
		  pathway. Conclusion: miR-381 suppresses cell proliferation,
		  migration and invasion in HNSCC through targeting STC2, and
		  participates in HNSCC development probably via the FAK/
		  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.},

  abstract	= {Malignant cells are known to have accelerated metabolism,
		  high glucose requirements, and increased glucose uptake.
		  Transport of glucose across the plasma membrane of
		  mammalian cells is the first rate-limiting step for glucose
		  metabolism and is mediated by facilitative glucose
		  transporter (GLUT) proteins. Increased glucose transport in
		  malignant cells has been associated with increased and
		  deregulated expression of glucose transporter proteins,
		  with overexpression of GLUT1 and/or GLUT3 a characteristic
		  feature. Oncogenic transformation of cultured mammalian
		  cells causes a rapid increase of glucose transport and
		  GLUT1 expression via interaction with GLUT1 promoter
		  enhancer elements. In human studies, high levels of GLUT1
		  expression in tumors have been associated with poor
		  survival. Studies indicate that glucose transport in breast
		  cancer is not fully explained by GLUT1 or GLUT3 expression,
		  suggesting involvement of another glucose transporter.
		  Recently, a novel glucose transporter protein, GLUT12, has
		  been found in breast and prostate cancers. In human breast
		  and prostate tumors and cultured cells, GLUT12 is located
		  intracellularly and at the cell surface. Trafficking of
		  GLUT12 to the plasma membrane could therefore contribute to
		  glucose uptake. Several factors have been implicated in the
		  regulation of glucose transporter expression in breast
		  cancer. Hypoxia can increase GLUT1 levels and glucose
		  uptake. Estradiol and epidermal growth factor, both of
		  which can play a role in breast cancer cell growth,
		  increase glucose consumption. Estradiol and epidermal
		  growth factor also increase GLUT12 protein levels in
		  cultured breast cancer cells. Targeting GLUT12 could
		  provide novel methods for detection and treatment of breast

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent or metastatic
		  squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC)
		  progressing after first-line platinum regimens have a poor
		  prognosis and few treatment options. Afatinib, an
		  irreversible ERBB family blocker, has shown efficacy in a
		  phase 2 study in this setting. We aimed to assess the
		  efficacy and safety of afatinib compared with methotrexate
		  as second-line treatment in patients with recurrent or
		  metastatic HNSCC progressing on or after platinum-based
		  therapy.
		  
		  METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled
		  trial conducted in 101 centres in 19 countries, we enrolled
		  patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or
		  cytologically confirmed HNSCC that was recurrent,
		  metastatic, or both who had progressed on or after
		  first-line platinum-based therapy, were not amenable for
		  salvage surgery or radiotherapy, and who had an Eastern
		  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
		  or 1. Previous treatment with more than one systemic
		  regimen in this setting was not allowed; previous treatment
		  with EGFR-targeted antibody therapy (but not EGFR-targeted
		  tyrosine-kinase inhibitors) was allowed. We randomly
		  assigned eligible patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral
		  afatinib (40 mg/day) or intravenous methotrexate (40
		  mg/m(2) per week), stratified by ECOG performance status
		  and previous EGFR-targeted antibody therapy for recurrent
		  or metastatic disease. Randomisation was done centrally
		  with an interactive voice or web-based response system.
		  Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment
		  allocation; independent review of tumour response was done
		  in a blinded manner. The primary endpoint was
		  progression-free survival as assessed by an independent,
		  central imaging review committee. Efficacy analyses were
		  done in the intention-to-treat population and safety
		  analyses were done in patients who received at least one
		  dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with
		  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01345682.
		  
		  FINDINGS: Between Jan 10, 2012, and Dec 12, 2013, we
		  enrolled 483 patients and randomly assigned 322 to afatinib
		  and 161 to methotrexate. After a median follow-up of
		  6{\textperiodcentered}7 months (IQR
		  3{\textperiodcentered}1-9{\textperiodcentered}0),
		  progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group
		  than in the methotrexate group (median
		  2{\textperiodcentered}6 months [95{\%} CI
		  2{\textperiodcentered}0-2{\textperiodcentered}7] for the
		  afatinib group vs 1{\textperiodcentered}7 months
		  [1{\textperiodcentered}5-2{\textperiodcentered}4] for the
		  methotrexate group; hazard ratio [HR]
		  0{\textperiodcentered}80 [95{\%} CI
		  0{\textperiodcentered}65-0{\textperiodcentered}98],
		  p=0{\textperiodcentered}030). The most frequent grade 3 or
		  4 drug-related adverse events were rash or acne (31
		  [10{\%}] of 320 patients in the afatinib group vs none of
		  160 patients in the methotrexate group), diarrhoea (30
		  [9{\%}] vs three [2{\%}]), stomatitis (20 [6{\%}] vs 13
		  [8{\%}]), fatigue (18 [6{\%}] vs five [3{\%}]), and

		  adverse events occurred in 44 (14{\%}) of afatinib-treated
		  patients and 18 (11{\%}) of methotrexate-treated patients.
		  
		  INTERPRETATION: Afatinib was associated with significant
		  improvements in progression-free survival and had a
		  manageable safety profile. These findings provide important
		  new insights into the treatment of this patient population
		  and support further investigations with irreversible ERBB

  abstract	= {In modern drug discovery, virtual screening is an
		  attractive and cost-effective approach, which is widely
		  applied to filter chemical compound libraries for the
		  identification of novel inhibitors. Epidermal growth factor
		  receptor protein is a well reported anticancer molecular
		  target due to its over expression and mutation in many
		  solid tumours. The decline in epidermal growth factor
		  receptor activity by small molecules has proved to be an
		  effective treatment for cancer. To design inhibitors for
		  this target, the crystal structures information of
		  epidermal growth factor receptors, co-crystallized with its
		  inhibitors, provide a gateway to perform receptor-based
		  drug designing studies, whereas the inhibitors with their
		  biological activity reported in literature provide
		  information to carry out ligand-based drug designing
		  studies. In the present study, the drug designing methods
		  were strategically combined and used parallely on a library
		  of 50,000 drug-like compounds from ChemDiv and ChemBridge
		  database, for the selection of potential inhibitors of
		  epidermal growth factor receptor. This resulted in the
		  identification of 200 common hits, which were further
		  pruned down to 87, based on the knowledge about the key
		  interaction of known epidermal growth factor receptor
		  inhibitors with Met793. These 87 hits were clustered into
		  12 different structural moieties. In vitro studies of some
		  of these hits were also carried out in order to validate
		  the screening approach. Further, the lead optimization
		  studies were performed by analyzing the binding poses of
		  all the identified structural moieties in order to
		  ascertain the scope of modifications around these moieties.
		  Molecular dynamics simulation studies further revealed some
		  important residues of the target which may be helpful for
		  providing stability to the enzyme-inhibitor complex. These
		  findings could be very much helpful for a medicinal chemist

  abstract	= {Abstract: Thymosin $\beta$4 (T$\beta$4) is a ubiquitous,
		  naturally occurring, 43-amino acid peptide that takes part
		  in several biological activities including angiogenesis,
		  inhibition of inflammation, wound healing, chemotaxis, and
		  endothelial cell migration. Recent studies also indicate
		  that T$\beta$4 accelerates corneal wound healing and
		  downregulates several proinflamatory chemokines and
		  cytokines. In this study, we sought to determine whether
		  T$\beta$4 is naturally occurring in human tears and other
		  human bodily fluids, such as saliva. Tear and saliva
		  samples were analyzed by EIA to identify and quantify the
		  amount of T$\beta$4 present. Around 10–20 samples were
		  collected from each of three different age groups: 15–20,
		  25–35, and {\textgreater}50 years old with n= 30 and n=
		  60 for tears and saliva, respectively. Exclusion criteria
		  included the use of any topical ophthalmic or topical oral
		  medication and/or history of ocular or oral surgery within
		  the past 6 months. Tears were collected from both eyes
		  using Schirmer's strips. Saliva samples were collected in
		  sterile tubes and were then centrifuged to remove solid
		  particles. T$\beta$4 was found in tear and saliva samples
		  in all age groups. The concentrations ranged from 0.5–7
		  $\mu$g/mL in tears and 0.2–3.6 $\mu$g/mL in saliva. In
		  both fluids, T$\beta$4 concentration varied with age and
		  appeared to peak at ages 25–35 years. Studies are in
		  progress to determine if T$\beta$4 levels in saliva and
		  tears demonstrate a circadian rhythm during a 24-h period,
		  as well as to confirm that they vary with age and to
		  explore if they vary with diseased states. This is the
		  first study to report the presence of T$\beta$4 in human
		  tears and saliva. This finding raises the possibility that
		  T$\beta$4 acts as an endogenous agent contributing to the
		  rapid healing of corneal and oral wounds. Considering that
		  T$\beta$4 facilitates reepithelialization and modulates
		  anti-inflammatory mediators, T$\beta$4 could potentially be
		  used therapeutically in the treatment of (a) ocular surface
		  disease and injury of eye and (b) various oral disorders,
		  such as periodontal disease.},

  abstract	= {Thymosin $\beta$4 (T$\beta$4), a multifunctional 44-amino
		  acid polypeptide and a member of actin-binding proteins
		  (ABPs), plays an important role in developmental processes
		  and wound healing. In recent years an increasing number of
		  data has been published suggesting T$\beta$4's involvement
		  in tumorigenesis. However, T$\beta$4's role in melanoma
		  tumor development still remains to be elucidated. In our
		  study we demonstrate that T$\beta$4 is crucial for melanoma
		  adhesion and invasion. For the purpose of our research we
		  tested melanoma cell lines differing in invasive potential.
		  Moreover, we applied shRNAs to silence TMSB4X (gene
		  encoding T$\beta$4) expression in a cell line with high
		  TMSB4X expression. We found out that T$\beta$4 is not only
		  a component of focal adhesions (FAs) and interacts with
		  several FAs components but also regulates FAs formation. We
		  demonstrate that T$\beta$4 level has an impact on FAs'
		  number and morphology. Moreover, manipulation with TMSB4X
		  expression resulted in changes in cells' motility on
		  non-coated and Matrigel(TM) (resembling basement membrane
		  composition)-coated surfaces and drastically decreased
		  invasion abilities of the cells. Additionally, a
		  correlation between T$\beta$4 expression level and
		  exhibition of mesenchymal-like [epithelial-mesenchymal
		  transition (EMT)] features was discovered. Cells with
		  lowered TMSB4X expression were less EMT-progressed than
		  control cells. Summarizing, obtained results show that
		  T$\beta$4 by regulating melanoma cells' adhesion has an
		  impact on motility features and EMT. Our study not only
		  contributes to a better understanding of the processes
		  underlying melanoma cells' capacity to create metastases
		  but also highlights T$\beta$4 as a potential target for
		  melanoma management therapy.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blue light is part of the
		  visible light spectrum that does not generate harmful DNA
		  adducts associated with skin cancer and photoaging, and may
		  represent a safer therapeutic modality for treatment of
		  keloid scars and other fibrotic skin diseases. Our
		  laboratory previously demonstrated that light-emitting
		  diode (LED) red and infrared light inhibits proliferation
		  of skin fibroblasts. Moreover, different wavelengths of
		  light can produce different biological effects.
		  Furthermore, the effects of LED blue light (LED-BL) on
		  human skin fibroblasts are not well characterized. This
		  study investigated the effects of LED-BL on human skin
		  fibroblast proliferation, viability, migration speed, and
		  reactive oxygen-species (ROS) generation. METHODS AND
		  MATERIALS: Irradiation of adult human skin fibroblasts
		  using commercially-available LED-BL panels was performed in
		  vitro, and modulation of proliferation and viability was
		  quantified using the trypan blue dye exclusion assay,
		  migratory speed was assessed using time-lapse video
		  microscopy, and intracellular ROS generation was measured
		  using the dihydrorhodamine flow cytometry assay.
		  Statistical differences between groups were determined by
		  ANOVA and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Human skin fibroblasts
		  treated with LED-BL fluences of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 80
		  J/cm(2) demonstrated statistically significant
		  dose-dependent decreases in relative proliferation of
		  8.4{\%}, 29.1{\%}, 33.8{\%}, 51.7{\%}, and 55.1{\%},
		  respectively, compared to temperature and environment
		  matched bench control plates, respectively. LED-BL fluences
		  of 5, 30, 45, and 80 J/cm(2) decreased fibroblast migration
		  speed to 95 ± 7.0{\%} (P = 0.64), 81.3 ± 5.5{\%} (P =
		  0.021), 48.5 ± 2.7{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001), and 32.3 ±
		  1.9{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001), respectively, relative to
		  matched controls. LED fluences of 5, 10, 30, and 80 J/cm(2)
		  resulted in statistically significant increases in reactive
		  oxygen species of 110.4{\%}, 116.6{\%}, 127.5{\%}, and
		  130{\%}, respectively, relative to bench controls.
		  CONCLUSION: At the fluences studied, LED-BL can inhibit
		  adult human skin dermal fibroblast proliferation and
		  migration speed, and is associated with increased reactive
		  oxygen species generation in a dose-dependent manner
		  without altering viability. LED-BL has the potential to
		  contribute to the treatment of keloids and other fibrotic
		  skin diseases and is worthy of further translational and
		  clinical investigation. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:210-215, 2015.

		  Our findings indicate that changes in mtDNA content during

  abstract	= {Cellular energy metabolism is one of the main processes
		  affected during the transition from normal to cancer cells,
		  and it is a crucial determinant of cell proliferation or
		  cell death. As a support for rapid proliferation, cancer
		  cells choose to use glycolysis even in the presence of
		  oxygen (Warburg effect) to fuel macromolecules for the
		  synthesis of nucleotides, fatty acids, and amino acids for
		  the accelerated mitosis, rather than fuel the tricarboxylic
		  acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria
		  biogenesis is also reprogrammed in cancer cells, and the
		  destiny of those cells is determined by the balance between
		  energy and macromolecule supplies, and the efficiency of
		  buffering of the cumulative radical oxygen species. In
		  glioblastoma, the most frequent and malignant adult brain
		  tumor, a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis is
		  observed, with regulation by well known genes as integrants
		  of oncogenic pathways such as phosphoinositide
		  3-kinase/protein kinase, MYC, and hypoxia regulated gene as
		  hypoxia induced factor 1. The expression profile of a set
		  of genes coding for glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid
		  cycle in glioblastoma cases confirms this metabolic switch.
		  An understanding of how the main metabolic pathways are
		  modified by cancer cells and the interactions between
		  oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes with these pathways
		  may enlighten new strategies in cancer therapy. In the
		  present review, the main metabolic pathways are compared in
		  normal and cancer cells, and key regulations by the main
		  oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are discussed.
		  Potential therapeutic targets of the cancer energetic
		  metabolism are enumerated, highlighting the astrocytomas,

  abstract	= {Worldwide, approximately 405 000 cases of oral cancer
		  (OSCC) are diagnosed each year, with a rising incidence in
		  many countries. Despite advances in surgery and
		  radiotherapy, which remain the standard treatment options,
		  the mortality rate has remained largely unchanged for
		  decades, with a 5-year survival rate of around 50{\%}. OSCC
		  is a heterogeneous disease, staged currently using the TNM
		  classification, supplemented with pathological information
		  from the primary tumour and loco-regional lymph nodes.
		  Although patients with advanced disease show reduced
		  survival, there is no single pathological or molecular
		  feature that identifies aggressive, early-stage tumours. We
		  retrospectively analysed 282 OSCC patients for disease
		  mortality, related to clinical, pathological, and molecular
		  features based on our previous functional studies [EGFR,
		  $\alpha$v$\beta$6 integrin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), p53,
		  p16, EP4]. We found that the strongest independent risk
		  factor of early OSCC death was a feature of stroma rather
		  than tumour cells. After adjusting for all factors, high
		  stromal SMA expression, indicating myofibroblast
		  transdifferentiation, produced the highest hazard ratio
		  (3.06, 95{\%} CI 1.65-5.66) and likelihood ratio (3.6;
		  detection rate: false positive rate) of any feature
		  examined, and was strongly associated with mortality,
		  regardless of disease stage. Functional assays showed that
		  OSCC cells can modulate myofibroblast transdifferentiation
		  through $\alpha$v$\beta$6-dependent TGF-$\beta$1 activation
		  and that myofibroblasts promote OSCC invasion. Finally, we
		  developed a prognostic model using Cox regression with
		  backward elimination; only SMA expression, metastasis,
		  cohesion, and age were significant. This model was
		  independently validated on a patient subset (detection rate
		  70{\%}; false positive rate 20{\%}; ROC analysis 77{\%}, p
		  {\textless} 0.001). Our study highlights the limited
		  prognostic value of TNM staging and suggests that an
		  SMA-positive, myofibroblastic stroma is the strongest
		  predictor of OSCC mortality. Whether used independently or
		  as part of a prognostic model, SMA identifies a significant
		  group of patients with aggressive tumours, regardless of
		  disease stage.},

  abstract	= {Loss of stromal fibroblast caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a
		  powerful single independent predictor of poor prognosis in
		  human breast cancer patients, and is associated with early
		  tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis and
		  tamoxifen-resistance. We developed a novel co-culture
		  system to understand the mechanism(s) by which a loss of
		  stromal fibroblast Cav-1 induces a "lethal tumor
		  micro-environment." Here, we propose a new paradigm to
		  explain the powerful prognostic value of stromal Cav-1. In
		  this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in
		  cancer-associated fibroblasts, which then acts as a
		  "metabolic" and "mutagenic" motor to drive tumor-stroma
		  co-evolution, DNA damage and aneuploidy in cancer cells.
		  More specifically, we show that an acute loss of Cav-1
		  expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative
		  stress and aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated
		  fibroblasts. Also, we propose that defective mitochondria
		  are removed from cancer-associated fibroblasts by
		  autophagy/mitophagy that is induced by oxidative stress. As
		  a consequence, cancer associated fibroblasts provide
		  nutrients (such as lactate) to stimulate mitochondrial
		  biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in adjacent cancer
		  cells (the "Reverse Warburg Effect"). We provide evidence
		  that oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts is
		  sufficient to induce genomic instability in adjacent cancer
		  cells, via a bystander effect, potentially increasing their
		  aggressive behavior. Finally, we directly demonstrate that
		  nitric oxide (NO) over-production, secondary to Cav-1 loss,
		  is the root cause for mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer
		  associated fibroblasts. In support of this notion,
		  treatment with anti-oxidants (such as N-acetyl-cysteine,
		  metformin and quercetin) or NO inhibitors (L-NAME) was
		  sufficient to reverse many of the cancer-associated
		  fibroblast phenotypes that we describe. Thus, cancer cells
		  use "oxidative stress" in adjacent fibroblasts (i) as an
		  "engine" to fuel their own survival via the stromal
		  production of nutrients and (ii) to drive their own
		  mutagenic evolution towards a more aggressive phenotype, by
		  promoting genomic instability. We also present evidence
		  that the "field effect" in cancer biology could also be
		  related to the stromal production of ROS and NO species.
		  eNOS-expressing fibroblasts have the ability to
		  downregulate Cav-1 and induce mitochondrial dysfunction in
		  adjacent fibroblasts that do not express eNOS. As such, the
		  effects of stromal oxidative stress can be laterally
		  propagated, amplified and are effectively
		  "contagious"--spread from cell-to-cell like a
		  virus--creating an "oncogenic/mutagenic" field promoting
		  widespread DNA damage.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Alterations in glucose metabolism and
		  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) constitute two
		  important characteristics of carcinoma progression toward
		  invasive cancer. Despite an extensive characterization of
		  each of them separately, the links between EMT and glucose
		  metabolism of tumor cells remain elusive. Here we show that
		  the neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3 contributes to
		  glucose uptake and proliferation of lung tumor cells that
		  have undergone an EMT.
		  
		  RESULTS: Using a panel of human non-small cell lung cancer
		  (NSCLC) cell lines, we demonstrate that GLUT3 is strongly
		  expressed in mesenchymal, but not epithelial cells, a
		  finding corroborated in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, we
		  identify that ZEB1 binds to the GLUT3 gene to activate
		  transcription. Importantly, inhibiting GLUT3 expression
		  reduces glucose import and the proliferation of mesenchymal
		  lung tumor cells, whereas ectopic expression in epithelial
		  cells sustains proliferation in low glucose. Using a large
		  microarray data collection of human NSCLCs, we determine
		  that GLUT3 expression correlates with EMT markers and is
		  prognostic of poor overall survival.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results reveal that GLUT3 is a
		  transcriptional target of ZEB1 and that this glucose
		  transporter plays an important role in lung cancer, when
		  tumor cells loose their epithelial characteristics to
		  become more invasive. Moreover, these findings emphasize
		  the development of GLUT3 inhibitory drugs as a targeted
		  therapy for the treatment of patients with poorly
		  differentiated tumors.},

  abstract	= {IMPORTANCE Positive margins are associated with poor
		  prognosis among patients with oral tongue squamous cell
		  carcinoma (SCC). However, wide variation exists in the
		  margin sampling technique. OBJECTIVE To determine the
		  effect of the margin sampling technique on local recurrence
		  (LR) in patients with stage I or II oral tongue SCC.
		  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective studywas
		  conducted from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 2012, in 5
		  tertiary care centers following tumor resection and
		  elective neck dissection in 280 patients with pathologic
		  (p)T1-2 pN0 oral tongue SCC. Analysis was conducted from
		  June 1, 2013, to January 20, 2015. INTERVENTIONS In group 1
		  (n = 119), tumor bed margins were not sampled. In group 2
		  (n = 61), margins were examined from the glossectomy
		  specimen, found to be positive or suboptimal, and revised
		  with additional tumor bed margins. In group 3 (n = 100),
		  margins were primarily sampled from the tumor bed without
		  preceding examination of the glossectomy specimen. The
		  margin status (both as a binary [positive vs negative] and
		  continuous [distance to the margin in millimeters]
		  variable) and other clinicopathologic parameters were
		  compared across the 3 groups and correlated with LR. MAIN
		  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Local recurrence. RESULTS Age, sex,
		  pT stage, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and
		  adjuvant radiation treatment were similar across the 3
		  groups. The probability of LR-free survival at 3 years was
		  0.9 and 0.8 in groups 1 and 3, respectively (P =.03). The
		  frequency of positive glossectomy margins was lowest in
		  group 1 (9 of 117 [7.7{\%}]) compared with groups 2 and 3
		  (28 of 61 [45.9{\%}] and 23 of 95 [24.2{\%}], respectively)
		  (P {\textless}.001). Even after excluding cases with
		  positive margins, the median distance to the closest margin
		  was significantly narrower in group 3 (2 mm) compared with
		  group 1 (3 mm) (P =.008). The status (positive vs negative)
		  of margins obtained from the glossectomy specimen
		  correlated with LR (P =.007), while the status of tumor bed
		  margins did not. The status of the tumor bed margin was
		  24{\%}sensitive (95{\%}CI, 16{\%}-34{\%}) and
		  92{\%}specific (95{\%}CI, 85{\%}-97{\%}) for detecting a
		  positive glossectomy margin. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The
		  margin sampling technique affects local control in patients
		  with oral tongue SCC. Reliance on margin sampling from the
		  tumor bed is associated with worse local control, most
		  likely owing to narrower margin clearance and greater
		  incidence of positive margins. A resection specimen-based
		  margin assessment is recommended.},

  abstract	= {Modeling of tumor growth has been performed according to
		  various approaches addressing different biocomplexity
		  levels and spatiotemporal scales. Mathematical treatments
		  range from partial differential equation based diffusion
		  models to rule-based cellular level simulators, aiming at
		  both improving our quantitative understanding of the
		  underlying biological processes and, in the mid- and long
		  term, constructing reliable multi-scale predictive
		  platforms to support patient-individualized treatment
		  planning and optimization. The aim of this paper is to
		  establish a multi-scale and multi-physics approach to tumor
		  modeling taking into account both the cellular and the
		  macroscopic mechanical level. Therefore, an already
		  developed biomodel of clinical tumor growth and response to
		  treatment is self-consistently coupled with a biomechanical
		  model. Results are presented for the free growth case of
		  the imageable component of an initially point-like
		  glioblastoma multiforme tumor. The composite model leads to
		  significant tumor shape corrections that are achieved
		  through the utilization of environmental pressure
		  information and the application of biomechanical
		  principles. Using the ratio of smallest to largest moment

		  our coupled approach, we have found a tumor shape
		  correction of 20{\%} by coupling biomechanics to the
		  cellular simulator as compared to a cellular simulation
		  without preferred growth directions. We conclude that the
		  integration of the two models provides additional
		  morphological insight into realistic tumor growth behavior.
		  Therefore, it might be used for the development of an
		  advanced oncosimulator focusing on tumor types for which

  abstract	= {High lactate generation and low glucose oxidation, despite
		  normal oxygen conditions, are commonly seen in cancer cells
		  and tumors. Historically known as the Warburg effect, this
		  altered metabolic phenotype has long been correlated with
		  malignant progression and poor clinical outcome. However,
		  the mechanistic relationship between altered glucose
		  metabolism and malignancy remains poorly understood. Here
		  we show that inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
		  (PDC) activity contributes to the Warburg metabolic and
		  malignant phenotype in human head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma. PDC inhibition occurs via enhanced expression of
		  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), which results in
		  inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
		  alpha (PDHalpha) subunit. We also demonstrate that PDC
		  inhibition in cancer cells is associated with normoxic
		  stabilization of the malignancy-promoting transcription
		  factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by
		  glycolytic metabolites. Knockdown of PDK-1 via short
		  hairpin RNA lowers PDHalpha phosphorylation, restores PDC
		  activity, reverts the Warburg metabolic phenotype,
		  decreases normoxic HIF-1alpha expression, lowers hypoxic
		  cell survival, decreases invasiveness, and inhibits tumor
		  growth. PDK-1 is an HIF-1-regulated gene, and these data
		  suggest that the buildup of glycolytic metabolites,
		  resulting from high PDK-1 expression, may in turn promote
		  HIF-1 activation, thus sustaining a feed-forward loop for
		  malignant progression. In addition to providing anabolic
		  support for cancer cells, altered fuel metabolism thus
		  supports a malignant phenotype. Correction of metabolic
		  abnormalities offers unique opportunities for cancer
		  treatment and may potentially synergize with other cancer
		  therapies.},

@Article{	  mcintyre2012,
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The tumor-specific EGFR deletion mutant,
		  EGFRvIII, is characterised by ligand-independent
		  constitutive signalling. Tumors expressing EGFRvIII are
		  resistant to current EGFR-targeted therapy. The frequency
		  of EGFRvIII in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC) is disputed and may vary by specific sub-site. The
		  purpose of this study was to measure the occurrence of
		  EGFRvIII mutations in a specific HNSCC subsite, oral
		  squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), using a novel real-time PCR
		  assay.
		  
		  METHODOLOGY: Pre-treatment Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded
		  (FFPE) cancer specimens from 50 OSCC patients were
		  evaluated for the presence of EGFRvIII using a novel
		  hydrolysis probe-based real-time PCR assay. EGFR protein
		  expression in tumor samples was quantified using
		  fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
		  AQUA{\textregistered} technology.
		  
		  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We detected EGFRvIII in a single OSCC
		  patient in our cohort (2{\%}). We confirmed the validity of
		  our detection technique in an independent cohort of
		  glioblastoma patients. We also compared the sensitivity and
		  specificity of our novel real-time EGFRvIII detection assay
		  to conventional RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Our assay can
		  specifically detect EGFRvIII and can discriminate against
		  wild-type EGFR in FFPE tumor samples.
		  AQUAnalysis{\textregistered} revealed that the presence of
		  EGFRvIII transcript is associated with very high EGFR
		  protein expression (98(th) percentile). Contrary to
		  previous reports, only 44{\%} of OSCC over-expressed EGFR
		  in our study.
		  
		  CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the
		  EGFRvIII mutation is rare in OSCC and corroborate previous
		  reports of EGFRvIII expression only in tumors with extreme
		  over-expression of EGFR. We conclude that EGFRvIII-specific
		  therapies may not be ideally suited as first-line treatment
		  in OSCC. Furthermore, highly specific and sensitive
		  methods, such as the real-time RT-PCR assay and
		  AQUAnalysis{\textregistered} described here, will provide
		  accurate assessment of EGFR mutation frequency and EGFR
		  expression, and will facilitate the selection of optimal
		  tailored therapies for OSCC patients.},

		  species (RNS) direct the activation of distinct signaling
		  pathways that determine cell fate. In this study, the
		  pathways activated and the mechanisms by which ROS and RNS
		  control the viability of pancreatic $\beta$-cells were
		  examined. Although both nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide
		  (H₂O₂) induce DNA damage, reduce cell viability, and
		  activate AMPK, the mechanisms of AMPK activation and cell
		  death induction differ between each reactive species.
		  Nitric oxide activates the unfolded protein and heat shock
		  responses and MAPK kinase signaling, whereas H₂O₂
		  stimulates p53 stabilization and poly(ADP-ribose)
		  polymerase (PARP) activation but fails to induce the
		  unfolded protein or heat shock responses or MAPK
		  activation. The control of cell fate decisions is selective
		  for the form of stress. H₂O₂-mediated reduction in
		  $\beta$-cell viability is controlled by PARP, whereas cell
		  death in response to nitric oxide is PARP independent but
		  associated with the nuclear localization of GAPDH. These
		  findings show that both ROS and RNS activate AMPK, induce
		  DNA damage, and reduce cell viability; however, the
		  pathways controlling the responses of $\beta$-cells are
		  selective for the type of reactive species.},

  abstract	= {Mammalian cells depend on glucose as a major substrate for
		  energy production. Glucose is transported into the cell via
		  facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT) present in all
		  cell types. Many GLUT isoforms have been described and
		  their expression is cell-specific and subject to hormonal
		  and environmental control. The kinetic properties and
		  substrate specificities of the different isoforms are
		  specifically suited to the energy requirements of the
		  particular cell types. Due to the ubiquitousness of these
		  transporters, their differential expression is involved in
		  various disease states such as diabetes, ischemia and
		  cancer. The majority of cancers and isolated cancer cell
		  lines over-express the GLUT family members which are
		  present in the respective tissue of origin under
		  non-cancerous conditions. Moreover, due to the requirement
		  of energy to feed uncontrolled proliferation, cancer cells
		  often express GLUTs which under normal conditions would not
		  be present in these tissues. This over-expression is
		  predominantly associated with the likelihood of metastasis
		  and hence poor patient prognosis. This article presents a
		  review of the current literature on the regulation and
		  expression of GLUT family members and has compiled clinical
		  and research data on GLUT expression in human cancers and

  abstract	= {Agents targeting EGFR and related ErbB family proteins are
		  valuable therapies for the treatment of many cancers. For
		  some tumor types, including squamous cell carcinomas of the
		  head and neck (SCCHN), antibodies targeting EGFR were the
		  first protein-directed agents to show clinical benefit, and
		  remain a standard component of clinical strategies for
		  management of the disease. Nevertheless, many patients
		  display either intrinsic or acquired resistance to these
		  drugs; hence, major research goals are to better understand
		  the underlying causes of resistance, and to develop new
		  therapeutic strategies that boost the impact of EGFR/ErbB
		  inhibitors. In this review, we first summarize current
		  standard use of EGFR inhibitors in the context of SCCHN,
		  and described new agents targeting EGFR currently moving
		  through pre-clinical and clinical development. We then
		  discuss how changes in other transmembrane receptors,
		  including IGF1R, c-Met, and TGF-$\beta$, can confer
		  resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors, and discuss new
		  agents targeting these proteins. Moving downstream, we
		  discuss critical EGFR-dependent effectors, including
		  PLC-$\gamma$; PI3K and PTEN; SHC, GRB2, and RAS and the
		  STAT proteins, as factors in resistance to EGFR-directed
		  inhibitors and as alternative targets of therapeutic
		  inhibition. We summarize alternative sources of resistance
		  among cellular changes that target EGFR itself, through
		  regulation of ligand availability, post-translational
		  modification of EGFR, availability of EGFR partners for
		  hetero-dimerization and control of EGFR intracellular
		  trafficking for recycling versus degradation. Finally, we
		  discuss new strategies to identify effective therapeutic
		  combinations involving EGFR-targeted inhibitors, in the
		  context of new system level data becoming available for
		  analysis of individual tumors.},

		  spots were extracted and analyzed for their peptide
		  sequence. The resulting internal protein sequences provided
		  evidence for the identification of a new calcium-binding
		  protein. Cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA was
		  achieved by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
		  using two keratinocyte libraries, one from proliferating
		  cultured keratinocytes and one from differentiated
		  keratinocytes of reconstructed human epidermis. The cDNA
		  had an open reading frame encoding a new calcium-binding

		  family. We named this new protein calmodulin-like skin
		  protein (CLSP), since reverse transcriptase-polymerase
		  chain reaction studies of CLSP expression in 10 different
		  human tissues revealed that this protein was particularly
		  abundant in the epidermis where its expression is directly

		  is able to bind calcium, and similarly to calmodulin,

		  subclassify OSCC based on survival. Experimental Design: We
		  analyzed the expression of 131 genes in 119 OSCC, 35
		  normal, and 17 dysplastic mucosa to identify
		  cluster-defined subgroups. Multivariate Cox regression was
		  used to estimate the association between gene expression
		  and survival. By stepwise Cox regression, the top
		  predictive models of OSCC-specific survival were determined
		  and compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis.
		  Results: The 3-year overall mean ± SE survival for a
		  cluster of 45 OSCC patients was 38.7 ± 0.09{\%} compared
		  with 69,1 ± 0.08{\%} for the remaining patients.
		  Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and stage
		  showed that the 45 OSCC patient cluster had worse overall
		  and OSCC- specific survival (hazard ratio, 3,31; 95{\%}
		  confidence interval, 1.66-6.58 and hazard ratio, 5,43;
		  95{\%} confidence interval, 2.32-12.73, respectively).
		  Stepwise Cox regression on the131 probe sets revealed that
		  a model with a term for LAMC2 (laminin $\gamma$ 2) gene
		  expression best identified patients with worst
		  OSCC-specific survival. We fit a Cox model with a term for

		  or PCA. The area under the curve for models combining stage
		  with either LAMC2 or PCA was 0,80 or 0.82, respectively,
		  compared with 0.70 for stage alone (P = 0.013 and 0.008,

		  whose preferred location is the tongue. Classically, this
		  disease has affected men preferentially, although recent
		  studies suggest that trends are changing and the proportion

		  prevalence of oral cancer is also determined by some risk
		  factors as alcohol consumption and tobacco. Currently, the

		  to determine whether a histological risk pattern indicative
		  of higher recurrence might be present in T1-T2 tumors
		  located in the anterior two thirds of the tongue. Material
		  and Methods: Samples from 26 patients with OSCC were
		  analyzed and histological risk pattern of recurrent and
		  non-recurrent tumors were compared. We have analyzed
		  histological variables described in Anneroth and
		  Brandwein-Gensler classifications. Additionally, we have

		  (ctDNA) may be relevant in early diagnosis and eventually
		  improve the outcomes of patients with head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Genome-wide discovery
		  using RNA sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite
		  sequencing yielded 21 candidates for methylation-targeted
		  genes. A verification study (252 HNSCC patients) using

		  genes ( ATP2A1 , CALML5 , DNAJC5G , GNMT , GPT , LY6D ,
		  LYNX1 , MAL , MGC16275 , and MRGPRF ) that showed a
		  significant increase recurrence in methylation groups with
		  OPC. Further study on ctDNA using Q-MSP in HPV-associated
		  OPC showed that three genes ( CALML5 , DNAJC5G , and LY6D )
		  had a high predictive ability as emerging biomarkers for a
		  validation set, each capable of discriminating between the

  abstract	= {Despite progress in treatment approaches for oral cancer,
		  there has been only modest improvement in patient outcomes
		  in the past three decades. The frequent treatment failure
		  is due to the failure to control tumor recurrence and
		  metastasis. These failures suggest that new targets should
		  be identified to reverse oral epithelial dysplastic
		  lesions. Recent developments suggest an active role of
		  glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) in various
		  human cancers either as a tumor suppressor or as a tumor
		  promoter. GSK3beta is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, and there
		  is emerging evidence that it is a tumor suppressor in oral
		  cancer. The evidence suggests a link between key players in
		  oral cancer that control transcription, accelerated cell
		  cycle progression, activation of invasion/metastasis and
		  anti-apoptosis, and regulation of these factors by
		  GSK3beta. Moreover, the major upstream kinases of GSK3beta
		  and their oncogenic activation by several etiological
		  agents of oral cancer support this hypothesis. In spite of
		  all this evidence, a detailed analysis of the role of
		  GSK3beta in oral cancer and of its therapeutic potential
		  has yet to be conducted by the scientific community. The

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Light microscopy is of central importance in
		  cell biology. The recent introduction of automated high
		  content screening has expanded this technology towards
		  automation of experiments and performing large scale
		  perturbation assays. Nevertheless, evaluation of microscopy
		  data continues to be a bottleneck in many projects.
		  Currently, among open source software, CellProfiler and its
		  extension Analyst are widely used in automated image
		  processing. Even though revolutionizing image analysis in
		  current biology, some routine and many advanced tasks are
		  either not supported or require programming skills of the
		  researcher. This represents a significant obstacle in many
		  biology laboratories.
		  
		  RESULTS: We have developed a tool, Enhanced CellClassifier,
		  which circumvents this obstacle. Enhanced CellClassifier
		  starts from images analyzed by CellProfiler, and allows
		  multi-class classification using a Support Vector Machine
		  algorithm. Training of objects can be done by clicking
		  directly "on the microscopy image" in several intuitive
		  training modes. Many routine tasks like out-of focus
		  exclusion and well summary are also supported.
		  Classification results can be integrated with other object
		  measurements including inter-object relationships. This
		  makes a detailed interpretation of the image possible,
		  allowing the differentiation of many complex phenotypes.
		  For the generation of the output, image, well and plate
		  data are dynamically extracted and summarized. The output
		  can be generated as graphs, Excel-files, images with
		  projections of the final analysis and exported as
		  variables.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Here we describe Enhanced CellClassifier which
		  allows multiple class classification, elucidating complex
		  phenotypes. Our tool is designed for the biologist who
		  wants both, simple and flexible analysis of images without
		  requiring programming skills. This should facilitate the
		  implementation of automated high-content screening.},

  abstract	= {It is well established that exposure of mammalian cells to
		  hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) suppresses mitochondrial function
		  by inhibiting cytochrome-c oxidase (CcOX; complex IV).
		  However, recent experimental data show that administration
		  of H(2)S to mammalian cells can serve as an electron donor
		  and inorganic source of energy. The aim of our study was to
		  investigate the role of endogenously produced H(2)S in the
		  regulation of mitochondrial electron transport and
		  oxidative phosphorylation in isolated liver mitochondria
		  and in the cultured murine hepatoma cell line Hepa1c1c7.
		  Low concentrations of H(2)S (0.1-1 $\mu$M) elicited a
		  significant increase in mitochondrial function, while
		  higher concentrations of H(2)S (3-30 $\mu$M) were
		  inhibitory. The positive bioenergetic effect of H(2)S
		  required a basal activity of the Krebs cycle and was most
		  pronounced at intermediate concentrations of succinate.
		  3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP), the substrate of the
		  mitochondrial enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
		  (3-MST) stimulated mitochondrial H(2)S production and
		  enhanced mitochondrial electron transport and cellular
		  bioenergetics at low concentrations (10-100 nM), while at
		  higher concentrations, it inhibited cellular bioenergetics.
		  SiRNA silencing of 3-MST reduced basal bioenergetic
		  parameters and prevented the stimulating effect of 3-MP on
		  mitochondrial bioenergetics. Silencing of sulfide quinone
		  oxidoreductase (SQR) also reduced basal and 3-MP-stimulated
		  bioenergetic parameters. We conclude that an endogenous
		  intramitochondrial H(2)S-producing pathway, governed by
		  3-MST, complements and balances the bioenergetic role of
		  Krebs cycle-derived electron donors. This pathway may serve
		  a physiological role in the maintenance of mitochondrial
		  electron transport and cellular bioenergetics.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is an insulin
		  facilitated glucose transporter that plays an important
		  role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. GLUT4 is
		  sequestered into intracellular vesicles in unstimulated
		  cells and translocated to the plasma membrane by various
		  stimuli. Understanding the structural details of GLUT4 will
		  provide insights into the mechanism of glucose transport
		  and its regulation. To date, a crystal structure for GLUT4
		  is not available. However, earlier work from our laboratory
		  proposed a well validated homology model for GLUT4 based on
		  the experimental data available on GLUT1 and the crystal
		  structure data obtained from the glycerol 3-phosphate
		  transporter. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present
		  study, the dynamic behavior of GLUT4 in a membrane
		  environment was analyzed using three forms of GLUT4 (apo,
		  substrate and ATP-substrate bound states). Apo form
		  simulation analysis revealed an extracellular open
		  conformation of GLUT4 in the membrane favoring easy
		  exofacial binding of substrate. Simulation studies with the
		  substrate bound form proposed a stable state of GLUT4 with
		  glucose, which can be a substrate-occluded state of the
		  transporter. Principal component analysis suggested a
		  clockwise movement for the domains in the apo form, whereas
		  ATP substrate-bound form induced an anti-clockwise
		  rotation. Simulation studies suggested distinct
		  conformational changes for the GLUT4 domains in the ATP
		  substrate-bound form and favor a constricted behavior for
		  the transport channel. Various inter-domain hydrogen bonds
		  and switching of a salt-bridge network from E345-R350-E409
		  to E345-R169-E409 contributed to this ATP-mediated channel
		  constriction favoring substrate occlusion and prevention of
		  its release into cytoplasm. These data are consistent with
		  the biochemical studies, suggesting an inhibitory role for
		  ATP in GLUT-mediated glucose transport.
		  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In the absence of a crystal
		  structure for any glucose transporter, this study provides
		  mechanistic details of the conformational changes in GLUT4
		  induced by substrate and its regulator.},

		  implemented in order to assess improvements in insulin
		  sensitivity in 3T3-L1 cells by elevation of glucose uptake
		  following treatment with stevioside. Oil Red-O staining and

		  staining, confirming the differentiation process.
		  Stevioside was noncytotoxic to 3T3-L1 cells as cell
		  viability was reduced by a maximum of 17{\%}, making it
		  impossible to determine its IC50. Stevioside increased
		  glucose uptake activities by 2.1 times (p {\textless}

  abstract	= {The advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
		  technologies has opened new perspectives in deciphering the
		  genetic mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Nowadays,
		  the amount of genomic data is massive and substantial
		  efforts and new tools are required to unveil the
		  information hidden in the data. The Genomic Data Commons
		  (GDC) Data Portal is a platform that contains different
		  genomic studies including the ones from The Cancer Genome
		  Atlas (TCGA) and the Therapeutically Applicable Research to
		  Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiatives,
		  accounting for more than 40 tumor types originating from
		  nearly 30000 patients. Such platforms, although very
		  attractive, must make sure the stored data are easily
		  accessible and adequately harmonized. Moreover, they have
		  the primary focus on the data storage in a unique place,
		  and they do not provide a comprehensive toolkit for
		  analyses and interpretation of the data. To fulfill this
		  urgent need, comprehensive but easily accessible
		  computational methods for integrative analyses of genomic
		  data that do not renounce a robust statistical and
		  theoretical framework are required. In this context, the
		  R/Bioconductor package TCGAbiolinks was developed, offering
		  a variety of bioinformatics functionalities. Here we
		  introduce new features and enhancements of TCGAbiolinks in
		  terms of i) more accurate and flexible pipelines for
		  differential expression analyses, ii) different methods for
		  tumor purity estimation and filtering, iii) integration of
		  normal samples from other platforms iv) support for other
		  genomics datasets, exemplified here by the TARGET data.
		  Evidence has shown that accounting for tumor purity is
		  essential in the study of tumorigenesis, as these factors
		  promote confounding behavior regarding differential
		  expression analysis. With this in mind, we implemented
		  these filtering procedures in TCGAbiolinks. Moreover, a
		  limitation of some of the TCGA datasets is the
		  unavailability or paucity of corresponding normal samples.
		  We thus integrated into TCGAbiolinks the possibility to use
		  normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
		  project, which is another large-scale repository cataloging
		  gene expression from healthy individuals. The new
		  functionalities are available in the TCGAbiolinks version

		  rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured in Xenopus
		  laevis oocytes heterologously expressing mammalian Glut
		  isoforms. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was also measured in 3T3-L1
		  fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and primary rat adipocytes.
		  RESULTS: The sensitivity to inhibition by indinavir among
		  the Glut isoforms as assayed in the X. laevis oocyte system
		  was as follows in decreasing order: Glut4
		  {\textgreater}{\textgreater} Glut2 {\textgreater} Glut3
		  {\textgreater} Glut1 approximately Glut8. 2-Deoxyglucose
		  uptake measurements in insulin-stimulated primary rat
		  adipocytes indicated a non-competitive mode of transport

		  relatively selective inhibitor of the Glut4 isoform. As the
		  concentration required to significantly inhibit

		  is well within the physiologic range achieved in therapy,
		  we conclude that direct inhibition of Glut4 contributes to

		  There is however no standard approach as to how frozen

		  in an attempt to establish consensus between surgeons and
		  pathologists with regards to margin sampling and acceptable
		  surgical margins. Methods A questionnaire consisting of
		  twelve questions was sent to surgical oncologists in
		  various head and neck cancer centers in India. It was
		  divided into two main subsets: 1) The definition of
		  surgical margins and 2) The use of frozen sections to

		  present study, we constructed an adenoviral vector encoding
		  human RUNX3 cDNA under the control of a Tet-responsive
		  promoter (Ad-Tet-FLAG-RUNX3), which regulates the
		  expression of RUNX3 in the presence or absence of
		  doxycycline. A recombinant adenoviral expression vector
		  encoding LacZ (Ad-Tet-LacZ) was used as a negative control.
		  The effect of the transduction of RUNX3 on cell growth was
		  examined using the Tet-On system in a human gastric
		  carcinoma cell line, MKN-1. Exogenous RUNX3 expression was
		  induced successfully by Ad-Tet-FLAG-RUNX3, but not
		  Ad-Tet-LacZ, in the presence of doxycycline in the MKN-1
		  cells. At 72 h after infection, the proliferative activity
		  in RUNX3-expressing cells was 55{\%} or less of that of the
		  control cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the sub-G(1)
		  peak was increased in cells expressing RUNX3 (34.11{\%}),
		  indicating that the inhibition of cell growth was due to
		  apoptosis, which was confirmed based on Hoechst 33258
		  staining, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
		  into the cytosol, and detection of cleaved caspase-3 by

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Molecular biomarkers are essential for
		  monitoring treatment effects, predicting prognosis, and
		  improving survival rate in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
		  This study sought to verify the effectiveness of two
		  integrin gene expression ratios as biomarkers.
		  
		  METHODS: Gene expression analyses of integrin $\alpha$3
		  (ITGA3), integrin $\beta$4 (ITGB4), CD9 antigen (CD9), and
		  plakoglobin (JUP) by quantitative real-time PCR were
		  conducted on total RNA from 270 OSCC cases. The logrank
		  test, Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier
		  estimates were performed on the gene expression ratios of
		  ITGA3/CD9 and ITGB4/JUP and on the clinicopathological
		  parameters for major clinical events.
		  
		  RESULTS: A high rate (around 80{\%}) of lymph node
		  metastasis was found in cases with a high ITGA3/CD9 ratio
		  (high-ITGA3/CD9) and invasive histopathology (YK4). Primary
		  site recurrence (PSR) was associated with high-ITGA3/CD9,
		  T3-4 (TNM class), and positive margin, indicating that PSR
		  is synergistically influenced by treatment failure and
		  biological malignancy. A high ITGB4/JUP ratio
		  (high-ITGB4/JUP) was revealed to be a primary contributor
		  to distant metastasis without the involvement of
		  clinicopathological factors, suggesting intervention of a
		  critical step dependent on the function of the integrin
		  $\beta$4 subunit. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed positive
		  margin as a lethal treatment consequence in high-ITGA3/CD9
		  and YK4 double-positive cases.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Two types of metastatic trait were found in
		  OSCC: locoregional dissemination, which was reflected by
		  high-ITGA3/CD9, and distant metastasis through hematogenous
		  dissemination, uniquely distinguished by high-ITGB4/JUP.
		  The clinical significance of the integrin biomarkers
		  implies that biological mechanisms such as cancer cell
		  motility and anchorage-independent survival are vital for
		  OSCC recurrence and metastasis.},

  abstract	= {Larger organisms have more potentially carcinogenic cells,
		  tend to live longer and require more ontogenic cell
		  divisions. Therefore, intuitively one might expect cancer
		  incidence to scale with body size. Evidence from mammals,
		  however, suggests that the cancer risk does not correlate
		  with body size. This observation defines "Peto's paradox."
		  Here, we propose a novel hypothesis to resolve Peto's
		  paradox. We suggest that malignant tumors are disadvantaged
		  in larger hosts. In particular, we hypothesize that natural
		  selection acting on competing phenotypes among the cancer
		  cell population will tend to favor aggressive "cheaters"
		  that then grow as a tumor on their parent tumor, creating a
		  hypertumor that damages or destroys the original neoplasm.
		  In larger organisms, tumors need more time to reach lethal
		  size, so hypertumors have more time to evolve. So, in large
		  organisms, cancer may be more common and less lethal. We
		  illustrate this hypothesis in silico using a previously
		  published hypertumor model. Results from the model predict
		  that malignant neoplasms in larger organisms should be
		  disproportionately necrotic, aggressive, and vascularized
		  than deadly tumors in small mammals. These predictions may
		  serve as the basis on which to test the hypothesis, but to
		  our knowledge, no one has yet performed a systematic
		  investigation of comparative necrosis, histopathology, or
		  vascularization among mammalian cancers.},

		  study of 1524 treatment naive patients with oral cavity SCC
		  who underwent surgery from January 2012 to March 2015 was
		  conducted. Survival analysis was performed using Cox
		  regression model. Results: The incidence of PNI was
		  20.3{\%} and higher in tongue cancers (odds ratio 2.43).
		  The PNI significantly affected both disease-free survival
		  (DFS; hazard ratio [HR] 1.84) as well as overall survival
		  (OS; HR 1.7). Patients with early node-negative oral cavity
		  SCC with PNI are more likely to develop recurrences and
		  have mortality (HR 2.79 for DFS; HR 2.54 for OS). However,
		  the addition of adjuvant radiation in these patients showed
		  improvement in survival (p =.022). Forest plot analysis
		  showed a trend toward poor survival across all subgroups in

		  for the majority of oral cancers. Despite recent advances
		  in OSCC diagnostics and therapeutics, the overall survival
		  rate still remains low. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a
		  combinatorial arsenic trioxide (ATO) and cisplatin (CDDP)
		  treatment in human OSCC cells.
		  
		  METHODS: The combinatorial effect of ATO/CDDP on the growth
		  and apoptosis of OSCC cell lines HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4
		  was evaluated using MTT and annexin V assays, respectively.
		  Chou-Talalay analyses were preformed to evaluate the
		  combinatorial effects of ATO/CDDP on the dose-reduction
		  index (DRI). To clarify the mechanism underlying the
		  ATO/CDDP anticancer effect, we also examined the
		  involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
		  ATO/CDDP-induced apoptosis.
		  
		  RESULTS: Combination index (CI) analyses revealed that a
		  synergistic interaction of ATO and CDDP elicits a wide
		  range of effects in HSC-2 cells, with CI values ranging
		  from 0.78 to 0.90, where CI {\textless} 1 defines
		  synergism. The CI values in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells ranged
		  from 0.34 to 0.45 and from 0.60 to 0.92, respectively. In
		  addition, ATO/CDDP yielded favorable DRI values ranging
		  from 1.6-fold to 7.71-fold dose reduction. Compared to
		  mono-therapy, ATO/CDDP combinatorial therapy significantly
		  augmented the loss of mitochondrial potential, caspase-3/7
		  activity and subsequent apoptosis. These changes were all
		  abrogated by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence for a
		  synergistic ATO/CDDP anticancer (apoptotic) activity in
		  OSCC cells with a favorable DRI, thereby highlighting its
		  potential as a combinational therapeutic regime in OSCC.},

		  carcinoma tumors and is of prognostic value in predicting
		  recurrence. In a retrospective study, 4E overexpression in
		  the margins appeared to be a more sensitive predictor of
		  recurrence when compared with p53. The goal was to confirm
		  this finding in a prospective study and also to compare the
		  expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to 4E
		  expression in tumors and margins. Other objectives were to
		  determine which of these markers have prognostic
		  significance in predicting recurrence and elucidate whether
		  there is any additional benefit to analysis of surgical
		  margins with a combination of the three molecular markers.
		  STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was performed on all
		  patients who consecutively underwent primary surgical
		  resection between 1998 and 1999 for head and neck squamous
		  cell carcinoma. Patient and tumor characteristics were
		  reviewed, and time to recurrence was noted. METHODS:
		  Paraffin-embedded sections of tumors and all histologically
		  tumor-free margins were analyzed for the presence or
		  absence of 4E, p53, and MMP-9 with immunohistochemical
		  analysis. Patients were followed according to the
		  institution's head and neck cancer protocol, and time to
		  recurrence was noted. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of
		  tumors overexpressed 4E, 65{\%} overexpressed p53, and
		  92{\%} overexpressed MMP-9. Of the 52 patients with
		  tumor-free margins, 52{\%}, 46{\%}, and 54{\%} had positive
		  margins for 4E, p53, and MMP-9, respectively. Although no
		  significant correlation between 4E and p53 expression was
		  seen in the margins (P =.16), a significant correlation
		  between 4E and MMP-9 expression was noted (P =.0002).
		  However, when expression of 4E and p53 in the margins of
		  only the patients who overexpressed p53 in the tumors was
		  compared (n = 34), there was a significant correlation (P
		  =.04). There was also a significant difference in the
		  disease-free interval between patients with 4E-positive and
		  4E-negative margins (P =.003). This difference in time to
		  recurrence was not significant for the p53-positive versus
		  the p53-negative group (P =.18) but approached significance
		  when MMP-9 was used as a marker (P =.07). Although the
		  univariate analysis showed that stage, nodal disease,
		  grade, and 4E expression in the margins were significantly
		  associated with disease-free interval, in the Cox multiple
		  regression analysis, only 4E expression in the margin was
		  significantly associated with disease-free interval (P
		  =.01). CONCLUSIONS: The era for molecular analysis of
		  surgical margins is here. Although a significant
		  correlation was seen between 4E and MMP-9, overexpression
		  of 4E appears to be a significant predictor of recurrence
		  when compared with the well-studied tumor suppressor gene
		  p53 and a relatively novel marker, MMP-9.},

  abstract	= {In the present study, we examined signal transduction
		  mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and
		  the role of ROS in angiotensin II-induced activation of
		  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in rat neonatal
		  cardiomyocytes. Among three MAPKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal
		  kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK required ROS production for
		  activation, as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor,
		  diphenyleneiodonium, inhibited the activation. The
		  angiotensin II-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAPK was
		  also inhibited by the expression of the
		  G$\alpha$12/13-specific regulator of G protein signaling
		  (RGS) domain, a specific inhibitor of G$\alpha$12/13, but
		  not by an RGS domain specific for G$\alpha$q.
		  Constitutively active G$\alpha$12- or G$\alpha$13-induced
		  activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, but not extracellular
		  signal-regulated kinase (ERK), was inhibited by
		  diphenyleneiodonium. Angiotensin II receptor stimulation
		  rapidly activated G$\alpha$13, which was completely
		  inhibited by the G$\alpha$12/13-specific RGS domain.
		  Furthermore, the G$\alpha$12/13-specific but not the
		  G$\alpha$q-specific RGS domain inhibited angiotensin
		  II-induced ROS production. Dominant negative Rac inhibited
		  angiotensin II-stimulated ROS production, JNK activation,
		  and p38 MAPK activation but did not affect ERK activation.
		  Rac activation was mediated by Rho and Rho kinase, because
		  Rac activation was inhibited by C3 toxin and a Rho kinase
		  inhibitor, Y27632. Furthermore, angiotensin II-induced Rho
		  activation was inhibited by G$\alpha$12/13-specific RGS
		  domain but not dominant negative Rac. An inhibitor of
		  epidermal growth factor receptor kinase AG1478 did not
		  affect angiotensin II-induced JNK activation cascade. These
		  results suggest that G$\alpha$12/13-mediated ROS production
		  through Rho and Rac is essential for JNK and p38 MAPK
		  activation. Previous Section Next Section Ang II1 is a
		  bioactive peptide involved in cardiac hypertrophy (1).
		  Receptor stimulation by Ang II is assumed to activate Gq
		  and Gi and turns on various signaling cascades dependent on
		  cell types. Many groups have reported the regulation of
		  MAPKs including JNK (2, 3), ERK (4, 5), and p38 MAPK (6) in
		  a variety of cells (7). MAPKs are thought to be key
		  intracellular transducers of mitogenic stimulation and have
		  been implicated in the signaling pathways leading to
		  cardiac hypertrophy (8, 9). An earlier study demonstrated
		  that Ang II-induced JNK activation is dependent on
		  extracellular calcium and protein kinase C and partially on
		  a tyrosine kinase (2). On the other hand, Ang II-induced
		  ERK activation is mediated by the Ras pathway or protein
		  kinase C pathway (10). A recent study showed that
		  $\beta$-arrestin-mediated internalization of ATR is
		  involved in ERK activation (11). ERK or p38 MAPK activation
		  by Ang II requires the EGF receptor transactivation,
		  whereas JNK activation is regulated by other signaling
		  proteins (7). These results indicate that the signal
		  transduction mechanism of MAPK activation depends on the
		  types of MAPKs and cellular contexts that are analyzed. ROS
		  such as hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals play various
		  roles in living cells as a second messenger to elicit
		  physiological responses or as a toxic intermediate leading
		  to cellular damage (12). Recent studies suggest that ROS
		  work as regulators of signal transduction (13, 14). We have
		  reported that heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins are putative
		  target molecules of ROS (15, 16). Although Ang II produces
		  ROS in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes
		  (6, 17, 18), the molecular mechanism of ROS production and
		  the identification of ROS target molecules are largely
		  unknown. Rac, one of the small GTP-binding proteins, is
		  believed to participate in the production of ROS by
		  activating NADPH oxidase in neutrophil (19). Previous
		  findings have demonstrated that one of the Rac effector
		  PAKs mediates JNK activation by Ang II, and PAK
		  phosphorylates a subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex (20).
		  MAPKs are activated by Rac as well as RhoA and Raf-1, and
		  the resulting activation of MAPKs induces hypertrophic
		  responses through the activation of intracellular signaling
		  cascades (21-24). However, upstream molecules of and the
		  relationship between these intracellular signaling
		  molecules are not fully determined. G12 family G proteins,
		  G12 and G13, couple with various G protein-coupled
		  receptors and mediate physiological responses by
		  interacting with different signaling proteins (25). The
		  role of G12/13 in the heart, however, has not been revealed
		  because of the unavailability of a specific inhibitor.
		  Recent studies showed that p115RhoGEF has an RGS domain for

  abstract	= {The predominant mechanism by which insulin activates
		  glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissue is by
		  affecting the redistribution of the facilitated hexose
		  carriers, GLUT1 and GLUT4, from an intracellular site to
		  the plasma membrane. A quantitative analysis of this
		  process has been hampered by the lack of reliable
		  determinations for kinetic constants catalyzed by each of
		  these isoforms. In order to obtain such information, each
		  transporter was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the
		  injection of mRNA encoding rat GLUT1 or GLUT4. Equilibrium
		  exchange 3-O-methylglucose uptake was measured and the data
		  fitted to a two-compartment model, yielding Km = 26.2 mM
		  and Vmax = 3.5 nmol/min/cell for GLUT1 and Km = 4.3 mM and
		  Vmax = 0.7 nmol/min/cell for GLUT4. Measurement of the
		  abundance of cell surface transporters was accomplished by
		  two independent protocols: photolabeling with the
		  impermeant hexose analog
		  2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4
		  -yloxy)-2-propylamine and subcellular fractionation of
		  oocytes. Data obtained by either technique revealed that
		  the ratio of plasma membrane GLUT1 to GLUT4 was about 4;
		  this paralleled the relative maximal velocities for hexose
		  transport, indicating that the turn-over numbers for the
		  two isoforms were the same. Moreover, measurement of the
		  concentration of exofacially disposed transporters with
		  2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4
		  -yloxy)-2-propylamine allowed calculation of the turnover
		  number to be about 20,000 min-1. These data indicate that,
		  at low substrate concentrations, the catalytic efficiency
		  of GLUT4 is significantly greater than GLUT1. Extrapolation
		  to mammalian systems suggests that GLUT4 is responsible for
		  virtually all of the hexose uptake in insulin-responsive
		  targets, particularly in the presence of hormone.},

		  contributes to the development of obesity and metabolic
		  syndrome. Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) has been
		  identified a key regulator of GLUT4 transporter as well as
		  angiotensin IV (AngIV) receptor (AT4R). Although AngII-AT1R
		  axis appears as anorexigenic and as an effector of energy
		  expenditure, the impact of AngIV-IRAP/AT4R axis on energy
		  metabolism remains unknown. The aim was to determine the
		  role of IRAP in energy metabolism in mice METHODS AND
		  RESULTS: In adipocyte culture, plasminogen activator
		  inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) expression levels were diminished
		  in IRAP knockout (IRAP(-/-)) if compared with those of
		  wild-type (C57Bl/6J, WT) mice. Mice were fed high-fat diet
		  (32{\%} fat) at age of 8 weeks. At the entry, body weight,
		  body fat content, and parameters of saccharometabolism were
		  similar between groups. However, IRAP(-/-) mice exhibited
		  blunted body weight gain compared to that of WT mice,
		  despite comparable food intake and physical activity. At 20
		  weeks of age, IRAP(-/-) mice had 25{\%} lower body weight
		  than WT mice. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed

		  CONCLUSIONS: IRAP deficiency may leads to suppression of

  abstract	= {Importance: The achievement of complete tumor resection
		  with tumor-free margins is one of the main principles of
		  oncologic surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC). The negative prognostic influence of a positive
		  margin (PM) across all head and neck subsites has been well
		  established. National guidelines recommend the use of
		  adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in the setting of PM.
		  Objective: To determine the incidence of PM in HNSCC across
		  multiple subsites, as well as the factors associated with
		  its occurrence. Design, Setting, and Participants: This
		  retrospective cohort study used the National Cancer
		  Database to identify patients diagnosed with HNSCC between
		  2010 and 2014 and who underwent surgical resection (n =
		  28840). Main Outcomes and Measures: Predictors of PM rate
		  and likelihood to receive adjuvant CRT. Results: Among the
		  28840 patients included in this study, 19727 (68.4 {\%})
		  were men, and the average age was 62.4 years (range, 40 to
		  ≥90 years). In univariable analysis, a lower PM rate was
		  associated with higher facility volume (26.3{\%} for the
		  lowest volume quartile, 16.5{\%} for the middle 2
		  quartiles, and 10.8{\%} for the highest volume quartile)
		  and treatment at academic vs nonacademic facilities
		  (14.0{\%} vs 22.7{\%}). In multivariate analysis, those
		  treated at higher-volume facilities remained significantly
		  less likely to have PM (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95{\%}
		  CI, 0.83-0.88). The trend of decreasing PM rate with
		  increasing facility volume was observed in both academic
		  (aOR, 0.88 per 10-case volume increase [95{\%} CI,
		  0.85-0.91]) and nonacademic (aOR, 0.73 per 10-case volume
		  increase [95{\%} CI, 0.68-0.80]) facilities. There was no
		  association between facility volume and patient likelihood
		  of receiving adjuvant CRT in the setting of PM (compared
		  with CCPs: aOR, 0.98 per 10-case volume increase [95{\%}
		  CI, 0.84-1.14] for CCCPs; and aOR, 1.24 [95{\%} CI,
		  0.99-1.55] for INCPs). Conclusions and Relevance: These
		  findings suggest that high-volume facilities are associated
		  with lower rates of PM in the surgical treatment of HNSCC
		  in both academic and nonacademic settings. Facility volume
		  for head and neck oncologic surgeries may be considered a
		  benchmark for quality of care.},

		  of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/c-erbB-1)

		  metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with poor
		  prognosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects
		  of EGFR ligands on gelatinase expression and invasion in
		  HNSCC cell lines. We tested epidermal growth factor (EGF),
		  transforming growth factor $\alpha$, betacellulin,
		  heparin-binding EGF, and amphiregulin and measured
		  expression of gelatinases MMP-9 and MMP-2 in an established
		  squamous carcinoma cell line (Detroit-562) and in two cell
		  lines newly derived from patients with head and neck
		  cancers (SIHN-005A and SIHN-006). Incubation of the cell
		  lines with EGF-like ligands up-regulated MMP-9 (but not
		  MMP-2) expression as measured by semiquantitative reverse
		  transcription-PCR in a dose-dependent manner, with the
		  effects being most marked in cells with high EGFR levels
		  and undetectable in cells with low levels. Maximum
		  stimulation was obtained in a concentration range of 10-100
		  nM. In addition, we confirmed by zymography that
		  gelatinolytic activity consistent with MMP-9 (M(r) 92,000)
		  was up-regulated in parallel with increases in gene
		  expression. Betacellulin (which binds both to EGFR and
		  c-erbB-4 receptors) consistently increased MMP- 9
		  expression and activation to a significantly greater degree
		  than the other four ligands when tested at equimolar
		  concentrations. In parallel with MMP-9 up-regulation, all
		  EGF-like ligands increased tumor cell invasion through
		  Matrigel in in vitro Transwell assays. These activities
		  were independent of ligand effects on cell proliferation.
		  Antagonist (ICR62) or agonist (ICR9) anti-EGFR monoclonal
		  antibodies, respectively, inhibited or potentiated MMP-9
		  activity and tumor cell invasion induced by all ligands.
		  Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes MMP-9
		  activity (Ab1) also inhibited ligand-induced invasion of
		  HNSCC. We confirmed that tumor cell lines used in these
		  studies (and a larger series not reported here) generally
		  expressed multiple c-erbB receptors and ligands. These
		  results indicate that autocrine or paracrine signaling
		  through EGFR potentiates the invasive potential of HNSCC
		  via the selective up-regulation and activation of MMP-9.
		  Furthermore, ligands such as betacellulin (which is
		  commonly expressed in HNSCC), which can bind to and
		  activate other c-erbB receptors, may be especially potent
		  in this regard.},

		  STUDY DESIGN: The metabolome profiles, including the

		  phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), and
		  amino acids, were obtained from OSCC and its surrounding
		  normal tissues (32 patients) using capillary

		  RESULTS: Enhancement of glucose consumption and lactate
		  production (Warburg effect) was observed in OSCC tissues.
		  The decrease of glucose along with the decrease of the
		  downstream intermediates in the EMPP suggests that
		  incorporated glucose is mainly consumed for biosynthesis.
		  Glutamine consumption with the increase of the
		  intermediates in the last half of the TCAC suggests the
		  involvement of glutaminolysis, in which glutamine is

  abstract	= {Background and Objective: Growing evidence of
		  transcriptional and metabolomic differentiation induced
		  many studies which analyze such differentiation in context
		  of outcome of disease progression, treatment or influence
		  of many different factors affecting cellular and tissue
		  metabolism. Particularly, cancer researchers are looking
		  for new biomarkers that can serve as a
		  diagnostic/prognostic factor and its further corresponding
		  relationship regarding clinical effects. As a result of the
		  increasing interest in use of dichotomization of continuous
		  variables involving clinical or epidemiological data (gene
		  expression, biomarkers, biochemical parameters, etc.) there
		  is a large demand for cutoff point determination tools with
		  simultaneous lack of software offering stratification of
		  patients based on continuous and binary variables.
		  Therefore, we developed “Evaluate Cutpoints”
		  application offering wide set of statistical and graphical
		  methods for cutpoint optimization enabling stratification
		  of population into two or three groups. Methods:
		  Application is based on R language including algorithms of
		  packages such as survival, survMisc, OptimalCutpoints,
		  maxstat, Rolr, ggplot2, GGally and plotly offering
		  Kaplan-Meier plots and ROC curves with cutoff point
		  determination. Results: All capabilities of Evaluate
		  Cutpoints were illustrated with example analysis of
		  estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2
		  receptors in breast cancer cohort. Through ROC curve the
		  cutoff points were established for expression of ESR1, PGR
		  and ERBB2 in correlation with their immunohistochemical
		  status (cutoff: 1301.253, 243.35, 11,434.438, respectively;
		  sensitivity: 94{\%}, 85{\%}, 64{\%}, respectively;
		  specificity: 93{\%}, 86{\%}, 91{\%}, respectively). Through
		  disease-free survival analysis we divided patients into two
		  and three groups regarding expression of ESR1, PGR and
		  ERBB2. Example algorithm cutp showed that lowered
		  expression of ESR1 and ERBB2 was more favorable (HR = 2.07,
		  p = 0.0412; HR = 2.79, p = 0.0777, respectively), whereas
		  heightened PGR expression was correlated with better
		  prognosis (HR = 0.192, p = 0.0115). Conclusions: This work
		  presents application Evaluate Cutpoints that is freely
		  available to download at
		  http://wnbikp.umed.lodz.pl/Evaluate-Cutpoints/. Currently,
		  many softwares are used to split continuous variables such
		  as Cutoff Finder and X-Tile, which offer distinct
		  algorithms. Unlike them, Evaluate Cutpoints allows not only
		  dichotomization of populations into groups according to
		  continuous variables and binary variables, but also
		  stratification into three groups as well as manual
		  selection of cutoff point thus preventing potential loss of
		  information.},

  abstract	= {AIMS: We investigated whether actin-sequestering protein,
		  thymosin beta-4 (TB4)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)
		  affect the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription
		  factor (HIF)-1alpha and paclitaxel-resistance induction.
		  MAIN METHODS: HeLa human cervical tumor cells were used.
		  The percentage of cell survival was determined by MTT
		  assay. ROS production, cell cycle and hypodiploid cell
		  formation were assessed by flow cytometry analysis.
		  HIF-1alpha stabilization and molecular changes were
		  analyzed by western blotting or RT-PCR. NF-kappaB
		  activation was assessed by EMSA and western blotting. KEY
		  FINDINGS: TB4 protein (TB4P) significantly increased
		  intracellular ROS level and HIF-1alpha. The increased level
		  of HIF-1alpha by TB4P was reduced by the treatment with
		  N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-known ROS scavenger.
		  TB4P-induced ROS production was confirmed by the activation
		  of nuclear factor kappa B. TB4P-induced Erk phosphorylation
		  was attenuated by the treatment with NAC. In addition,
		  tumor cell death was decreased by TB4 gene overexpression
		  and TB4P treatment. NAC treatment attenuated tumor cell
		  density increased by TB4P. Tumor cell death by paclitaxel
		  was also increased by NAC treatment or the transfection
		  with HIF-1alpha-siRNA. Paclitaxel-induced B16F10 mouse
		  melanoma regression was physiologically inhibited in
		  TB4-transgenic mice compared to wildtype mice.
		  SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that TB4-induced
		  ROS and ROS-mediated HIF-1alpha stabilization could play a
		  role in tumor cell resistance to anticancer agents like
		  paclitaxel. It suggests that soluble TB4 could be a novel
		  endogenous regulator to control intracellular ROS
		  production in tumor cells.},

@PhDThesis{	  ohman2015,
  abstract	= {The cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis postulates that
		  the immune system can recognize cancer cell precursors and
		  destroy those cells before a clinical manifestation occurs.
		  During the last decades several groups have presented
		  evidence of the influence and role of immune activation in
		  oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients; however, much
		  less is known about the role of immune activation in
		  potentially malignant oral disorders (PMOD). OSCC may be
		  preceded by a PMOD. Two of the most common PMODs in the
		  Western population are oral leukoplakia (LPL), defined as a
		  predominantly white patch in the oral mucosa that cannot be
		  characterized as any other definable lesion, and oral
		  lichen planus (OLP) defined as a chronic inflammation in
		  the oral mucosa manifested as bilateral white
		  hyperkeratotic striations with or without erythema,
		  ulceration, bullae or plaque. The general aim of this
		  thesis was to characterize the immune response in PMODs and
		  oral cancer and to relate immune response to malignant
		  transformation. Another aim was to address whether
		  long-term immunosuppression in a large cohort of solid
		  organ transplant (SOT) patients predisposes for cancer in
		  the oral cavity and lip. In papers I–III clinical data
		  and biopsy specimens were analysed from patients with OLP
		  and healthy oral mucosa (I), patients with LPL with and
		  without dysplasia and OSCC (II) and those with LPL with
		  dysplasia with (LPL-ca) or without (LPL-dys) malignant
		  transformation (III). Immunohistochemistry was used to
		  detect different cell types of interest, in particular,
		  subtypes of dendritic Langerhans cells (LCs) and T cells.
		  In paper IV a cohort of SOT patients were correlated with
		  the Swedish Cancer Register for prevalence of oral and lip
		  cancer and compared with the prevalence in the Swedish
		  population. Overall 5-year survival in SOT patients with
		  oral and lip cancer was compared to an age- and
		  gender-matched control group with oral and lip cancer
		  without previous SOT. In paper I the results showed that
		  OLP patients had a significantly higher number of dendritic
		  Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epithelium and the connective
		  tissue than in healthy control patients. Also, cells with
		  dendritic morphology and expressing the maturation marker
		  CD83 were found in clusters with lymphocytes in the
		  connective tissue. In paper II the results showed that both
		  cytotoxic T cells and dendritic Langerhans cells were
		  significantly increased in connective tissue in LPL with
		  dysplasia compared to LPL without dysplasia, indicating an
		  immune response to cells with cell dysplasia. In OSCC, the
		  influx of T cells and LCs was increased almost a
		  thousand-fold compared to LPL. Confocal laser scanning
		  microscopy revealed a co-localization of LCs and T cells in
		  LPL with dysplasia and OSCC, indicating possible immune
		  activation In paper III quantitative analyses showed that
		  patients with LPL displaying cell dysplasia that
		  transformed into OSCC had lower numbers of T cells than a
		  group of patients with LPL with dysplasia that did not
		  transform into OSCC during the observation period. In paper
		  IV the results showed a standardized incidence ratio (SIR)
		  that was increased for both oral (SIR: 6.3) and lip cancer
		  (SIR: 43.7) in SOT patients compared to non-SOT patients.
		  Also, the overall 5-year survival was decreased for lip
		  cancer in SOT patients compared to non-SOT lip cancer
		  patients. To conclude the findings in papers I, II and III,
		  evidence of immunosurveillance in PMOD and OSCC are
		  presented. After long-standing immunosuppression in
		  patients with SOT there is an increased risk for both lip
		  and oral cancer, and the overall survival for patients with
		  lip cancer is also negatively affected. The concept of
		  immunosurveillance originally proposed by Dunn et al. in
		  2004 is well in line with the findings in this thesis of
		  PMOD and oral cancer.},

  abstract	= {Contractile activity during physical exercise induces an
		  increase in GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle, helping to
		  improve glucose transport capacity and insulin sensitivity.
		  An important mechanism by which exercise upregulates GLUT4
		  is through the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent
		  protein kinase II (CaMKII) in response to elevated levels
		  of cytosolic Ca(2+) during muscle contraction. This review
		  discusses the mechanism by which Ca(2+) activates CaMKII,
		  explains research techniques currently used to alter CaMK
		  activity in cells, and highlights various exercise models
		  and pharmacological agents that have been used to provide
		  evidence that CaMKII plays an important role in regulating
		  GLUT4 expression. With regard to transcriptional
		  mechanisms, the key research studies that identified
		  myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and GLUT4 enhancer factor
		  as the major transcription factors regulating glut4 gene
		  expression, together with their binding domains, are
		  underlined. Experimental evidence showing that CaMK
		  activation induces hyperacetylation of histones in the
		  vicinity of the MEF2 domain and increases MEF2 binding to
		  its cis element to influence MEF2-dependent Glut4 gene
		  expression are also given along with data suggesting that
		  p300 might be involved in acetylating histones on the Glut4
		  gene. Finally, an appraisal of the roles of other calcium-
		  and non-calcium-dependent mechanisms, including the major
		  HDAC kinases in GLUT4 expression, is also given.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is more common in cancer survivors
		  than in the general population. The objective of the
		  present study was to determine cancer frequency in a cohort
		  of patients with diabetes and to examine demographic,
		  clinical, and quality of life differences between cancer
		  survivors and their cancer-free peers to inform better
		  individualized care.
		  
		  METHODS: Self-reported survey data from 3,466 registrants
		  with type 2 diabetes from Australia's National Diabetes
		  Services Scheme (NDSS) were analyzed to compare relevant
		  variables between cancer survivors and cancer-free
		  patients. Analyses were focused on breast and prostate
		  cancer to reflect the most common cancers in women and men,
		  respectively.
		  
		  RESULTS: Five percent of diabetic women reported a history
		  of breast cancer and 4.2{\%} of men reported a history of
		  prostate cancer. Diabetic patients with a history of breast
		  or prostate cancer were older at time of survey and
		  diabetes diagnosis, less likely to report metformin use
		  (women), and more likely to have two or more comorbidities
		  than their cancer-free peers. More diabetic prostate cancer
		  survivors also reported problems with mobility and
		  performing usual tasks. However, cancer-free diabetic
		  subjects reported a lower diabetes-dependent quality of
		  life than diabetic cancer survivors. There was no
		  association between cancer survivorship and duration of
		  diabetes, indices of glycemic control, obesity, or diabetic
		  complications.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors comprise a significant
		  minority of diabetic patients that are particularly
		  vulnerable and may benefit from interventions to increase
		  screening and treatment of other comorbidities and promote
		  a healthy lifestyle.},

  abstract	= {Previously, we demonstrated that A549, a human lung cancer
		  cell line, could be adapted to the free radical nitric
		  oxide (NO●). NO● is known to be over expressed in human
		  tumors. The original cell line, A549 (parent), and the
		  newly adapted A549-HNO (which has a more aggressive
		  phenotype) serve as a useful model system to study the
		  biology of NO●. To see if tumor cells can similarly be
		  adapted to any free radical with the same outcome, herein
		  we successfully adapted A549 cells to high levels of
		  hydrogen peroxide (HHP). A549-HHP, the resulting cell line,
		  was more resistant and grew better then the parent cell
		  line, and showed the following characteristics: (1)
		  resistance to hydrogen peroxide, (2) resistance to NO●,
		  (3) growth with and without hydrogen peroxide, and (4)
		  resistance to doxorubicin. Gene chip analysis was used to
		  determine the global gene expression changes between
		  A549-parent and A549-HHP and revealed significant changes
		  in the expression of over 1,700 genes. This gene profile
		  was markedly different from that obtained from the A549-HNO
		  cell line. The mitochondrial DNA content of the A549-HHP
		  line determined by quantitative PCR favored a change for a
		  more anaerobic metabolic profile. Our findings suggest that
		  any free radical can induce resistance to other free
		  radicals; this is especially important given that radiation
		  therapy and many chemotherapeutic agents exert their effect
		  via free radicals. Utilizing this model system to better
		  understand the role of free radicals in tumor biology will
		  help to develop new therapeutic approaches to treat lung

  abstract	= {The p53 tumor-suppressor plays a critical role in the
		  prevention of human cancer. In the absence of cellular
		  stress, the p53 protein is maintained at low steady-state
		  levels and exerts very little, if any, effect on cell fate.
		  However, in response to various types of stress, p53
		  becomes activated; this is reflected in elevated protein
		  levels, as well as augmented biochemical capabilities. As a
		  consequence of p53 activation, cells can undergo marked
		  phenotypic changes, ranging from increased DNA repair to
		  senescence and apoptosis. This review deals with the
		  mechanisms that underlie the apoptotic activities of p53,
		  as well as the complex interactions between p53 and central
		  regulatory signaling networks. In p53-mediated apoptosis,
		  the major role is played by the ability of p53 to
		  transactivate specific target genes. The choice of
		  particular subsets of target genes, dictated by covalent
		  p53 modifications and protein-protein interactions, can
		  make the difference between life and apoptotic death of a
		  cell. In addition, transcriptional repression of
		  antiapoptotic genes, as well as transcription-independent
		  activities of p53, can also contribute to the apoptotic
		  effects of p53. Regarding the crosstalk between p53 and
		  signaling networks, this review focuses on the interplay
		  between p53 and two pivotal regulatory proteins:
		  beta-catenin and Akt/PKB. Both proteins can regulate p53 as
		  well as be regulated by it. In addition, p53 interacts with
		  the GSK-3beta kinase, which serves as a link between Akt
		  and beta-catenin. This review discusses how the functional
		  balance between these different interactions might dictate
		  the likelihood of a given cell to become cancerous or be
		  eliminated from the replicative pool, resulting in
		  suppression of cancer.},

		  central to the mechanism. We also considered other
		  proposals for metformin action. As metabolic pathway
		  markers, we focused on glucose transport and fatty acid
		  oxidation. We also confirmed metformin actions on other
		  metabolic processes in L6 cells. Metformin stimulated both
		  glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation. The
		  mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor rotenone also stimulated
		  glucose transport but it inhibited fatty acid oxidation,
		  independently of metformin. The peroxynitrite generator
		  3-morpholinosydnonimine stimulated glucose transport, but
		  inhibited fatty acid oxidation. Addition of the nitric
		  oxide precursor arginine to cells did not affect glucose
		  transport. These studies differentiate metformin from
		  inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and from active
		  nitrogen species. Knockdown of adenylate kinase also failed
		  to affect metformin stimulation of glucose transport.
		  Hence, any means of increase in ADP appears not to be
		  involved in the metformin mechanism. Knockdown of LKB1, an
		  upstream kinase and AMPK activator, did not affect
		  metformin action. Having ruled out existing proposals, we
		  suggest a new one: metformin might increase AMP through
		  inhibition of AMP deaminase (AMPD). We found that metformin
		  inhibited purified AMP deaminase activity. Furthermore, a
		  known inhibitor of AMPD stimulated glucose uptake and fatty
		  acid oxidation. Both metformin and the AMPD inhibitor
		  suppressed ammonia accumulation by the cells. Knockdown of
		  AMPD obviated metformin stimulation of glucose transport.
		  We conclude that AMPD inhibition is the mechanism of

		  OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of p53 expression

  abstract	= {Background: Biclustering techniques are capable of
		  simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a data
		  matrix. These techniques became very popular for the
		  analysis of gene expression data, since a gene can take
		  part of multiple biological pathways which in turn can be
		  active only under specific experimental conditions. Several
		  biclustering algorithms have been developed in the past
		  recent years. In order to provide guidance regarding their
		  choice, a few comparative studies were conducted and
		  reported in the literature. In these studies, however, the
		  performances of the methods were evaluated through external
		  measures that have more recently been shown to have
		  undesirable properties. Furthermore, they considered a
		  limited number of algorithms and datasets. Results: We
		  conducted a broader comparative study involving seventeen
		  algorithms, which were run on three synthetic data
		  collections and two real data collections with a more
		  representative number of datasets. For the experiments with
		  synthetic data, five different experimental scenarios were
		  studied: different levels of noise, different numbers of
		  implanted biclusters, different levels of symmetric
		  bicluster overlap, different levels of asymmetric bicluster
		  overlap and different bicluster sizes, for which the
		  results were assessed with more suitable external measures.
		  For the experiments with real datasets, the results were
		  assessed by gene set enrichment and clustering accuracy.
		  Conclusions: We observed that each algorithm achieved
		  satisfactory results in part of the biclustering tasks in
		  which they were investigated. The choice of the best
		  algorithm for some application thus depends on the task at
		  hand and the types of patterns that one wants to detect.},

		  cell-surface transporter abundance (Bmax.) for the two
		  isoforms by displacing radiolabelled
		  2-N-[4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis-(D-
		  mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) by non-labelled
		  ATB-BMPA. In cells acutely treated with insulin, the GLUT1
		  Bmax. was 0.19 microM and the GLUT4 Bmax. was 0.17 microM.
		  In cells which were chronically treated with insulin, the
		  GLUT1 Bmax. was increased by approximately 4-fold to 0.7
		  microM, whereas the GLUT4 was decreased by approximately
		  50{\%} (Bmax. = 0.1 microM). However, this large increase
		  in total concentrations of cell-surface transporters (the
		  sum of GLUT1 and GLUT4 concentrations) was not reflected in
		  a large increase in 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport,
		  suggesting that GLUT1 makes a smaller contribution to
		  transport than does GLUT4. In acutely insulin-treated cells
		  at 37 degrees C, the apparent kinetic parameters for
		  3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport were Vapp.max. = 0.52 mM.s-1
		  and Kapp.m = 12.3 mM. In chronically insulin-treated cells
		  the Vapp.max. = 1.24 mM.s-1 and Kapp.m = 23.0 mM. We have
		  measured the displacement of ATB-BMPA by different
		  concentrations of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose to resolve the
		  separate affinity constants of GLUT1 and GLUT4 for this
		  transported ligand. In acute- and chronic-insulin-treated
		  cells the GLUT1 Km for 3-O-methyl-D-glucose was
		  approximately 20 mM, and the GLUT4 Km for
		  3-O-methyl-D-glucose was approximately 7 mM. An analysis of
		  these data and the 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport rates was
		  carried out to calculate transport capacity (TK values) for
		  the two isoforms at 37 degrees C. In acute- and
		  chronic-insulin-treated cells the TK values were 0.36 x
		  10(4) mM-1.min-1 for GLUT1 and 1.13 x 10(4) mM-1.min-1 for
		  GLUT4. Thus GLUT1 has an approximately 3-fold lower
		  transport capacity than GLUT4 at low concentrations of
		  transported sugar. The lower GLUT1 transport capacity was
		  shown to be mainly due to the high Km of GLUT1. The
		  calculated turnover numbers were 7.2 x 10(4) min-1 for
		  GLUT1 and 7.9 x 10(4) min-1 for GLUT4.},

		  Another aim of this study was to evaluate surgical margin
		  shrinkage after fixation of oral squamous cell carcinoma
		  (OSCC) specimens of the gingivobuccal sulcus (GBS).
		  Materials and Methods This was a cross-sectional study. The
		  study sample consisted of OSCC specimens of the GBS after
		  composite resection. The primary predictor variable was the
		  length of the linear margin at various locations (anterior,
		  posterior, medial, and lateral). The primary outcome
		  variable was the percentage of change in each respective
		  margin (anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral) after
		  fixation in 10{\%} formalin for 24 hours. Other variables
		  were age, gender, use of smokeless tobacco, smoking status,
		  and tumor staging. The difference between pre-fixation and
		  post-fixation data was calculated using paired t test.
		  Results The sample consisted of 15 patients (7 men and 8
		  women; age range, 55 to 65 yr) diagnosed with OSCC of the
		  GBS. Shrinkage of surgical margins (decrease) occurred
		  after fixation compared with margins before fixation. The
		  average surgical margin shrinkages were 18.7{\%}
		  anteriorly, 14.9{\%} posteriorly, 23.6{\%} medially, and
		  23.9{\%} laterally. This shrinkage was statistically
		  significant (P {\textless}.001). Conclusion Formalin
		  fixation causes considerable shrinkage of surgical margins.
		  This phenomenon should be considered by the pathologist

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Developments in 'soft' ionisation techniques
		  have revolutionized mass-spectro-metric approaches for the
		  analysis of protein structure. For more than a decade, such
		  techniques have been used, in conjuction with digestion b
		  specific proteases, to produce accurate peptide molecular
		  weight 'fingerprints' of proteins. These fingerprints have
		  commonly been used to screen known proteins, in order to
		  detect errors of translation, to characterize
		  post-translational modifications and to assign diulphide
		  bonds. However, the extent to which peptide-mass
		  information can be used alone to identify unknown sample
		  proteins, independent of other analytical methods such as
		  protein sequence analysis, has remained largely unexplored.
		  RESULTS: We report here on the development of the molecular
		  weight search (MOWSE) peptide-mass database at the SERC
		  Daresbury Laboratory. Practical experience has shown that
		  sample proteins can be uniquely identified from a few as
		  three or four experimentally determined peptide masses when
		  these are screened against a fragment database that is
		  derived from over 50 000 proteins. Experimental errors of a
		  few Daltons are tolerated by the scoring algorithms, thus
		  permitting the use of inexpensive time-of-flight mass
		  spectrometers. As with other types of physical data, such
		  as amino-acid composition or linear sequence, peptide
		  masses provide a set of determinants that are sufficiently
		  discriminating to identify or match unknown sample
		  proteins. CONCLUSION: Peptide-mass fingerprints can prove
		  as discriminating as linear peptide sequences, but can be
		  obtained in a fraction of the time using less protein. In
		  many cases, this allows for a rapid identification of a
		  sample protein before committing it to protein sequence
		  analysis. Fragment masses also provide information, at the
		  protein level, that is complementary to the information
		  provided by large-scale DNA sequencing or mapping
		  projects.},

		  luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like. METHODS A 50-gene
		  subtype predictor was developed using microarray and
		  quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
		  reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from
		  761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for
		  prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction
		  of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and
		  anthracycline regimen.
		  
		  RESULTS: The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed
		  prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained
		  significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated
		  standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic
		  grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for
		  node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic
		  subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for
		  the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a
		  significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic
		  model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model
		  predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative
		  predictive value for pCR of 97{\%}. CONCLUSION Diagnosis by
		  intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and
		  predictive information to standard parameters for patients
		  with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the
		  continuous risk score will be of value for the management
		  of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk

		  evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic implications of an
		  initial positive frozen section margin that was revised
		  until negative (microscopic tumor cut‐through), and to
		  analyze the influence of microscopic margin status on oral
		  carcinoma control. Methods The approach in our
		  investigation was through a retrospective review of
		  patients treated with primary surgery, with frozen section
		  margin control in oral carcinoma. Inclusion criteria
		  included availability of frozen and permanent section
		  histology reports of resection margins and negative final
		  resection margins. Results Of 547 patients studied, 175
		  received adjuvant radiation. Local and regional control and
		  disease‐specific survival rates were 81.6{\%}, 78.4{\%},
		  and 76.3{\%}, respectively. Tumor cut‐through and
		  pathologic nodal (pN) stage had an independently adverse
		  effect on local control. Tumor cut‐through adversely
		  affected cancer control and survival, but this effect
		  diminished significantly in the absence of regional
		  disease. Conclusions Microscopic tumor cut‐through
		  revised to negative margins is a powerful prognosticator
		  that is observed only when regional disease is also
		  present. The value of adjuvant therapeutic regimens is
		  questionable in patients with microscopic tumor

		  characteristics of myofibroblast differentiation by often
		  expressing the ultrastructure of alpha-smooth muscle actin
		  ($\alpha$SMA). However, heterogeneity among
		  cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with respect to
		  $\alpha$SMA expression, has been demonstrated in several
		  clinical studies of oral cancer. Like normal stem cells,
		  stem-like cancer cells (SLCCs) are also regulated
		  extrinsically by its microenvironment; therefore, we
		  postulated that the heterogeneous oral-CAFs would
		  differently regulate oral-SLCCs. Using transcriptomics, we
		  clearly demonstrated that the gene expression differences
		  between oral tumor-derived CAFs were indeed the molecular
		  basis of heterogeneity. This also grouped these CAFs in two
		  distinct clusters, which were named as C1 and C2.
		  Interestingly, the oral-CAFs belonging to C1 or C2 clusters
		  showed low or high $\alpha$SMA-score, respectively. Our
		  data with tumor tissues and in vitro co-culture experiments
		  interestingly demonstrated a negative correlation between
		  $\alpha$SMA-score and cell proliferation, whereas, the
		  frequency of oral-SLCCs was significantly positively
		  correlated with $\alpha$SMA-score. The oral-CAF-subtype
		  with lower score for $\alpha$SMA (C1-type CAFs) was more
		  supportive for cell proliferation but suppressive for the
		  self-renewal growth of oral-SLCCs. Further, we found the
		  determining role of BMP4 in C1-type CAFs-mediated
		  suppression of self-renewal of oral-SLCCs. Overall, we have
		  discovered an unexplored interaction between CAFs with
		  lower-$\alpha$SMA expression and SLCCs in oral tumors and
		  provided the first evidence about the involvement of
		  CAF-expressed BMP4 in regulation of self-renewal of oral-SLCCs.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Proton Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy
		  (MRS) is a widely available technique for those clinical
		  centres equipped with MR scanners. Unlike the rest of
		  MR-based techniques, MRS yields not images but spectra of
		  metabolites in the tissues. In pathological situations, the
		  MRS profile changes and this has been particularly
		  described for brain tumours. However, radiologists are
		  frequently not familiar to the interpretation of MRS data
		  and for this reason, the usefulness of decision-support
		  systems (DSS) in MRS data analysis has been explored.
		  
		  RESULTS: This work presents the INTERPRET DSS version 3.0,
		  analysing the improvements made from its first release in
		  2002. Version 3.0 is aimed to be a program that 1st, can be
		  easily used with any new case from any MR scanner
		  manufacturer and 2nd, improves the initial analysis
		  capabilities of the first version. The main improvements
		  are an embedded database, user accounts, more diagnostic
		  discrimination capabilities and the possibility to analyse
		  data acquired under additional data acquisition conditions.
		  Other improvements include a customisable graphical user
		  interface (GUI). Most diagnostic problems included have
		  been addressed through a pattern-recognition based
		  approach, in which classifiers based on linear discriminant
		  analysis (LDA) were trained and tested.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: The INTERPRET DSS 3.0 allows radiologists,
		  medical physicists, biochemists or, generally speaking, any
		  person with a minimum knowledge of what an MR spectrum is,
		  to enter their own SV raw data, acquired at 1.5 T, and to

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate
		  whether the immunohistochemical expression of p53, p21,
		  p27, cyclin D1, and Ki67 can predict therapy response and
		  survival in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous
		  cell carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiation.
		  METHODS: Biomarker expression was evaluated by
		  immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
		  pretreatment biopsies of 111 homogenously treated patients.
		  We assessed the association between clinicopathological
		  variables including response to neoadjuvant
		  chemoradiotherapy as well as the survival of the patients
		  and the expression of the biomarkers as both dichotomized
		  (positive vs. negative) and continuous variables. RESULTS:
		  Biomarker overexpression on the basis of pre-selected
		  cutoff points was seen in 66 of 111 (59{\%}) cases for p53,
		  in 77 (69{\%}) for p21, in 48 (43{\%}) for p27, in 81
		  (73{\%}) for cyclin D1, and in 54 (49{\%}) cases for Ki67,
		  respectively. None of the examined biomarkers was able to
		  predict response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or was
		  associated with survival outcome. Post-treatment pathologic
		  TNM stage (P {\textless} 0.001), pathologic response (P
		  {\textless} 0.001), and perineural invasion (P {\textless}
		  0.001) were the only factors having a significant effect on
		  recurrence-free survival. Post-treatment pathologic N stage
		  (P = 0.005), post-treatment pathologic TNM stage (P
		  {\textless} 0.001), pathologic response (P {\textless}
		  0.001), and perineural invasion (P = 0.001) had a
		  significant impact on overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our
		  results suggest that the biomarkers p53, p21, p27, cyclin
		  D1, and Ki67 have no impact on treatment response and
		  survival in patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer
		  treated with preoperative chemoradiation.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: The molecular mechanisms underlying lung
		  inflammation in toxic smoke inhalation injury are unknown.
		  We investigated the signaling pathway responsible for the
		  induction of interleukin 8 by wood smoke extract in lung
		  epithelial cells and lung inflammation induced by wood
		  smoke exposure in mice. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled
		  study. SETTING: A research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS AND
		  MAIN RESULTS: Exposure of primary human bronchial
		  epithelial cells to wood smoke extract sequentially
		  activated NADPH oxidase and increased intracellular
		  reactive oxygen species level; activated AMP-activated
		  protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and
		  Jun N-terminal kinase (two mitogen-activated protein
		  kinases), and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal
		  transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (two
		  transcription factors); and induced interleukin-8.
		  Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation with apocynin or
		  siRNA targeting p47(phox ) (a subunit of NADPH oxidase)
		  attenuated the increased intracellular reactive oxygen
		  species level, AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and
		  interleukin-8 induction. Removal of intracellular reactive
		  oxygen species by N-acetyl-cysteine reduced the activation
		  of AMP-activated protein kinase, extracellular
		  signal-regulated kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase, and
		  interleukin-8 induction. Prevention of AMP-activated
		  protein kinase activation by Compound C or AMP-activated
		  protein kinase siRNA lessened the activation of Jun
		  N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase,
		  nuclear factor-$\kappa$B, signal transducer and activator
		  of transcription protein 3 and interleukin-8 induction.
		  Inhibition of Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular
		  signal-regulated kinase activation by inhibitors reduced
		  the activation of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal
		  transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 and
		  interleukin-8 induction. Abrogation of nuclear
		  factor-$\kappa$B and signal transducer and activator of
		  transcription protein 3 activation by inhibitors attenuated
		  the interleukin-8 induction. Additionally, acute exposure
		  of mice to wood smoke promoted AMP-activated protein kinase
		  phosphorylation and expression of macrophage inflammatory
		  protein 2 (an interleukin-8 homolog) in lung epithelial
		  cells and lungs and lung inflammation, all of which were
		  reduced by Compound C treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-8
		  induction by wood smoke extract in lung epithelial cells is
		  mediated by novel NADPH oxidase-dependent, reactive oxygen
		  species-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase signaling
		  with Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular
		  signal-regulated kinase as the downstream kinases and
		  nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal transducer and
		  activator of transcription protein 3 as the downstream
		  transcription factors. This AMP-activated protein kinase
		  signaling is likely important for inducing lung
		  inflammation with toxic smoke exposure in mice.},

  abstract	= {The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is frequently mutated in
		  human cancers. More than 75{\%} of all mutations are
		  missense substitutions that have been extensively analyzed
		  in various yeast and human cell assays. The International
		  Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 database
		  (www-p53.iarc.fr) compiles all genetic variations that have
		  been reported in TP53. Here, we present recent database
		  developments that include new annotations on the functional
		  properties of mutant proteins, and we perform a systematic
		  analysis of the database to determine the functional
		  properties that contribute to the occurrence of mutational
		  "hotspots" in different cancer types and to the phenotype
		  of tumors. This analysis showed that loss of
		  transactivation capacity is a key factor for the selection
		  of missense mutations, and that difference in mutation
		  frequencies is closely related to nucleotide substitution
		  rates along TP53 coding sequence. An interesting new
		  finding is that in patients with an inherited missense
		  mutation, the age at onset of tumors was related to the
		  functional severity of the mutation, mutations with total
		  loss of transactivation activity being associated with
		  earlier cancer onset compared to mutations that retain
		  partial transactivation capacity. Furthermore, 80{\%} of
		  the most common mutants show a capacity to exert
		  dominant-negative effect (DNE) over wild-type p53, compared
		  to only 45{\%} of the less frequent mutants studied,
		  suggesting that DNE may play a role in shaping mutation
		  patterns. These results provide new insights into the
		  factors that shape mutation patterns and influence mutation
		  phenotype, which may have clinical interest.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: One of the most challenging problems in
		  biological image analysis is the quantification of the
		  dynamical mechanism and complexity of the intracellular
		  space. This paper investigates potential spatial chaos and
		  complex behavior of the intracellular space of typical
		  cancer and normal cell images whose structural details are
		  revealed by the combination of scanning electron microscopy
		  and focused ion beam systems. Such numerical
		  quantifications have important implications for computer
		  modeling and simulation of diseases.MethodsCancer cell
		  lines derived from a human head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (SCC-61) and normal mouse embryonic fibroblast
		  (MEF) cells produced by focused ion beam scanning electron
		  microscopes were used in this study. Spatial distributions
		  of the organelles of cancer and normal cells can be
		  analyzed at both short range and long range of the bounded
		  dynamical system of the image space, depending on the
		  orientations of the spatial cell. A procedure was designed
		  for calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent, which is an
		  indicator of the potential chaotic behavior in
		  intracellular images. Furthermore, the sample entropy and
		  regularity dimension were applied to measure the complexity
		  of the intracellular images.
		  
		  RESULTS: Positive values of the largest Lyapunov exponents
		  (LLEs) of the intracellular space of the SCC-61 were
		  obtained in different spatial orientations for both
		  long-range and short-range models, suggesting the chaotic
		  behavior of the cell. The MEF has smaller positive values
		  of LLEs in the long range than those of the SCC-61, and
		  zero vales of the LLEs in the short range analysis,
		  suggesting a non-chaotic behavior. The intracellular space
		  of the SCC-61 is found to be more complex than that of the
		  MEF. The degree of complexity measured in the spatial
		  distribution of the intracellular space in the diagonal
		  direction was found to be approximately twice larger than
		  the complexity measured in the horizontal and vertical
		  directions.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Initial findings are promising for
		  characterizing different types of cells and therefore
		  useful for studying cancer cells in the spatial domain
		  using state-of-the-art imaging technology. The measures of
		  the chaotic behavior and complexity of the spatial cell
		  will help computational biologists gain insights into
		  identifying associations between the oscillation patterns
		  and spatial parameters of cells, and appropriate model for
		  simulating cancer cell signaling networks for cancer
		  treatment and new drug discovery.},

		  To better understand the role of this small peptide we have
		  analyzed by means of transmission immunoelectron microscopy
		  techniques the ultrastructural localization of Tbeta4 in
		  HepG2 cells. Samples of HepG2 cells were fixed in a mixture
		  of 3{\%} formaldehyde and 0.1{\%} glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
		  cacodylate buffer and processed for standard electron
		  microscopic techniques. The samples were dehydrated in a

		  Ultrathin sections were labeled with rabbit antibodies to
		  Tbeta4, followed by gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit, stained
		  with uranyl acetate and bismuth subnitrate, observed and
		  photographed in a JEOL 100S transmission electron
		  microscope. High-resolution electron microscopy showed that
		  Tbeta4 was mainly restricted to the cytoplasm of HepG2
		  growing in complete medium. A strong Tbeta4 reactivity was
		  detected in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasmic
		  compartment where gold particles appeared strictly

		  that the occurrence of tumors involves complex biological
		  mechanisms, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an
		  important role in regulating the biological behavior of
		  tumors. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a group of

@Article{	  porto2007,
  abstract	= {Hemolysis or extensive cell damage can lead to high
		  concentrations of free heme, causing oxidative stress and
		  inflammation. Considering that heme induces neutrophil
		  chemotaxis, we hypothesize that heme activates a G
		  protein-coupled receptor. Here we show that similar to
		  heme, several heme analogs were able to induce neutrophil
		  migration in vitro and in vivo. Mesoporphyrins, molecules
		  lacking the vinyl groups in their rings, were not
		  chemotactic for neutrophils and selectively inhibited
		  heme-induced migration. Moreover, migration of neutrophils
		  induced by heme was abolished by pretreatment with
		  pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Galpha inhibitory protein,
		  and with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase,
		  phospholipase Cbeta, mitogen-activated protein kinases, or
		  Rho kinase. The induction of reactive oxygen species by
		  heme was dependent of Galpha inhibitory protein and
		  phosphoinositide 3-kinase and partially dependent of
		  phospholipase Cbeta, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated
		  protein kinases, and Rho kinase. Together, our results
		  indicate that heme activates neutrophils through signaling
		  pathways that are characteristic of chemoattractant
		  molecules and suggest that mesoporphyrins might prove
		  valuable in the treatment of the inflammatory consequences
		  of hemorrhagic and hemolytic disorders. .. The
		  immune/inflammatory responses triggered by molecules of
		  infectious agents or host origin are amplified by
		  cytokines, lipid mediators, and reactive oxygen species
		  (1). Diseases of increased intra- and extravascular
		  hemolysis or extensive cell damage can lead to high levels
		  of free heme (2-4). As the prosthetic moiety of inactive
		  apo-heme proteins, heme provides a wide range of biological
		  functions determined in part by the polypeptide associated
		  to it (5). Once released from heme proteins, free heme can
		  amplify the cell damage and the inflammatory response (6).
		  A hallmark of inflammation is the recruitment of leukocytes
		  out of the vasculature to tissues. This process depends on
		  the interplay of selected molecules on leukocytes and
		  endothelial cells occurring in several stages, the
		  so-called three steps paradigm of cell migration (7). Heme
		  seems to affect this process in several ways: (a) inducing
		  cell adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells; (b)
		  increasing vascular permeability; (c) enhancing chemokine
		  expression and secretion; (d) inducing migration of
		  leukocytes, especially neutrophils (6, 8). It has been
		  assumed and widely accepted that the mechanism by which
		  heme exerts its damaging effects relies on its amphipathic
		  nature, allowing heme to intercalate the cell or organelle
		  membranes, and on its pro-oxidant effects (6, 9, 10). The
		  induction of neutrophil migration by heme is dependent on
		  protein kinase C activation (8), and heme is able to delay
		  neutrophil apoptosis in vitro dependently of
		  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),4 extracellular-signaling
		  kinase (ERK), and NF-$\kappa$B pathways (11). The ability
		  of heme to induce neutrophil migration in vitro indicates
		  that heme is a chemoattractant. To date, the nature of
		  neutrophil chemoattractants includes a variety of peptides
		  (for example, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, C3a and C5a, and CXC
		  chemokines) and lipids (for example, PAF and LTB4), which
		  are, without exception, ligands of seven transmembrane
		  receptors coupled to a G$\alpha$ inhibitory (G$\alpha$i)
		  protein sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) (12). Binding
		  and activation of these receptors activate G$\alpha$i
		  protein, PI3K, and MAPKs, stimulating neutrophil migration
		  (13, 14). Thus, we hypothesize that heme acts on neutrophil
		  migration by activating a G$\alpha$i-coupled receptor. In
		  this study, we show the structural requirements by which
		  porphyrins affect neutrophil migration in vitro and promote
		  inflammation in vivo. Several heme analogs were able to
		  induce neutrophil migration, whereas mesoporphyrins,
		  molecules lacking the vinyl groups in their rings, were not
		  chemotactic for neutrophils and selectively inhibited the
		  migration induced by heme. The neutrophil migration and ROS
		  production induced by heme were inhibited by pertussis
		  toxin, thus indicating the involvement of a G$\alpha$i
		  protein. The use of selective inhibitors indicates that
		  heme activates neutrophils through signaling pathways that
		  are characteristic of chemoattractant molecules. Together,
		  these results suggest that heme activates neutrophils
		  through activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).},

		  Methods Pathology reports (n = 346) were reviewed. TBM
		  parameters were indexed. In Group 1 patients all margins
		  were obtained from the glossectomy specimen and there were
		  no TBM. In Revision Group/Group 2 (n = 103), tumor bed was
		  sampled to revise suboptimal margins identified by
		  examination of the glossectomy specimen. In Group 3 (n =
		  124), TBM were obtained before examination of the
		  glossectomy specimen. Results and Conclusions Fewer TBMs
		  were obtained per patient in Group 2 compared to Group 3
		  (57/103, 55{\%} of patients with {\textless}3 vs. 117/124,

		  was more frequently indicated in Group 2 compared to Group
		  3 (59/103, 57{\%}, vs. 19/124, 15{\%}, p {\textless}.001).
		  If glossectomy specimen margins are accepted as the

		  frozen vs. permanent pathology findings, precluding
		  judgment on final margin status. To facilitate the

  abstract	= {Lactic acidosis (3 to 40 mM, pH {\textless} 6.9) is a
		  condition found in solid tumors because tumor cells have a
		  high rate of glucose consumption and lactate production
		  even in the presence of oxygen; nevertheless, the
		  microenvironment might still provide a sufficient glucose
		  supply. Lactic acidosis has been proposed to shift
		  metabolism from aerobic glycolysis toward oxidative
		  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We tested if lung tumor cells
		  cultured under lactic acidosis shift their metabolism from
		  glycolysis to OXPHOS by consuming extracellular lactate,
		  increasing growth rate. We analyzed lung adenocarcinoma
		  (A-549, A-427) cell lines and non-transformed fibroblast
		  cells (MRC-5), which were cultured using RPMI-1640 medium
		  initially containing lactate (2 mM) and glucose (10 mM), at
		  pH 7.2 or 6.2 and oxygen tension 21{\%} O2 (normoxia) or
		  2{\%} O2 (hypoxia). We obtained growth curves, as well as
		  glucose consumption and lactate production rates (measured
		  during exponential growth) for each cell line.
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 $\alpha$), CS
		  (citrate synthase) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)
		  transcript levels were analyzed using RT-qPCR. By flow
		  cytometry, we determined: (a) expression of glucose
		  transporters (GLUT)1 and 4; (b) lactate transporters (MCT)1
		  and 4; (c) cell cycle profile, and (d) protein levels of
		  HIF-1$\alpha$, total and phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK).
		  Mitochondrial functionality was evaluated by measuring O2
		  consumption in tumor cells using polarography and a
		  Clark-type electrode. Tumor and non-transformed cells used
		  both aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS for obtaining energy. As
		  of 48 h of culture, lactate levels ranged from (4.5–14
		  mM), thus forming a lactic environment. Lactic acidosis
		  diminished GLUT1/GLUT4 expression and glucose consumption
		  in A-549, but not in A-427 cells, and induced differential
		  expression of HIF-1$\alpha$, AMPK, and CS transcripts.
		  A-427 cells increased pAMPK and HIF-1$\alpha$ levels and
		  shifted their metabolism increasing OXPHOS; thus supporting
		  cell growth. Conversely, A-549 cells increased
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ protein levels, but did not activate AMPK and
		  diminished OXPHOS. A-549 cells survived by arresting cells
		  in G1-phase. Our findings show that lactic acidosis
		  diminishes Warburg effect in tumor cells, but this change
		  does not necessarily promote a shift to OXPHOS. Hence, lung
		  adenocarcinomas show a differential metabolic response even
		  when they are under the same microenvironmental conditions.},

		  to test the tumorigenic potential of different populations
		  of cancer cells derived from primary, unmanipulated human
		  HNSCC samples. We show that a minority population of
		  CD44(+) cancer cells, which typically comprise
		  {\textless}10{\%} of the cells in a HNSCC tumor, but not
		  the CD44(-) cancer cells, gave rise to new tumors in vivo.
		  Immunohistochemistry revealed that the CD44(+) cancer cells
		  have a primitive cellular morphology and costain with the
		  basal cell marker Cytokeratin 5/14, whereas the CD44(-)
		  cancer cells resemble differentiated squamous epithelium
		  and express the differentiation marker Involucrin. The
		  tumors that arose from purified CD44(+) cells reproduced
		  the original tumor heterogeneity and could be serially
		  passaged, thus demonstrating the two defining properties of
		  stem cells: ability to self-renew and to differentiate.
		  Furthermore, the tumorigenic CD44(+) cells differentially
		  express the BMI1 gene, at both the RNA and protein levels.
		  By immunohistochemical analysis, the CD44(+) cells in the
		  tumor express high levels of nuclear BMI1, and are arrayed
		  in characteristic tumor microdomains. BMI1 has been
		  demonstrated to play a role in self-renewal in other stem

		  Therefore, inhibitors of aberrant mitochondrial fission
		  could provide important research tools in addition to
		  potential leads for drug development. Using a rational
		  approach, we designed a novel and selective peptide
		  inhibitor, P110, of excessive mitochondrial fission. P110
		  inhibits Drp1 enzyme activity and blocks Drp1/Fis1
		  interaction in vitro and in cultured neurons, whereas it
		  has no effect on the interaction between Drp1 and other
		  mitochondrial adaptors, as demonstrated by
		  co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, using a model of
		  Parkinson's disease (PD) in culture, we demonstrated that
		  P110 is neuroprotective by inhibiting mitochondrial
		  fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
		  and subsequently improving mitochondrial membrane potential
		  and mitochondrial integrity. P110 increased neuronal cell
		  viability by reducing apoptosis and autophagic cell death,
		  and reduced neurite loss of primary dopaminergic neurons in

		  have developed a new method for observing the translocation
		  of GLUT4 targeted with photostable and bright quantum dots
		  (QDs) in live L6 cells. QDs were targeted to GLUT4myc
		  specifically and internalized with GLUT4myc through
		  receptor-mediated endocytosis. Compared with traditional
		  fluorescence dyes and fluorescent proteins, QDs with high
		  brightness and extremely photostability are suitable for
		  long-term single particle tracking, so individual GLUT4-QD

  abstract	= {microRNAs are noncoding RNAs which downregulate a large
		  number of target mRNAs and modulate cell activity. Despite
		  continued progress, bioinformatics prediction of microRNA
		  targets remains a challenge since available software still
		  suffer from a lack of accuracy and sensitivity. Moreover,
		  these tools show fairly inconsistent results from one
		  another. Thus, in an attempt to circumvent these
		  difficulties, we aggregated all human results of four
		  important prediction algorithms (miRanda, PITA, SVmicrO,
		  and TargetScan) showing additional characteristics in order
		  to rerank them into a single list. Instead of deciding
		  which prediction tool to use, our method clearly helps
		  biologists getting the best microRNA target predictions
		  from all aggregated databases. The resulting database is
		  freely available through a webtool called miRabel1 which
		  can take either a list of miRNAs, genes, or signaling
		  pathways as search inputs. Receiver operating
		  characteristic curves and precision-recall curves analysis
		  carried out using experimentally validated data and very
		  large data sets show that miRabel significantly improves
		  the prediction of miRNA targets compared to the four
		  algorithms used separately. Moreover, using the same
		  analytical methods, miRabel shows significantly better
		  predictions than other popular algorithms such as MBSTAR,
		  miRWalk, ExprTarget and miRMap. Interestingly, an F-score
		  analysis revealed that miRabel also significantly improves
		  the relevance of the top results. The aggregation of
		  results from different databases is therefore a powerful
		  and generalizable approach to many other species to improve
		  miRNA target predictions. Thus, miRabel is an efficient
		  tool to guide biologists in their search for miRNA targets
		  and integrate them into a biological context.},

		  malignancies originating in the oral tissues, including
		  cancers of the lip, tongue, gingiva, floor of the mouth,
		  buccal mucosa, palate and the retromolar trigone. It is the
		  6th most common cancer worldwide3. Oral squamous cell
		  carcinoma is described as an invasive epithelial neoplasm
		  with varying degrees of squamous differentiation and a
		  propensity to early and extensive lymph node metastases,
		  occurring predominantly in alcohol and tobacco using adults
		  generally in the 5th and 6th decades of life. Globally
		  about 5, 00,000 new cases of oral and oropharyngeal cancers
		  are diagnosed and three quarters of these are from the
		  developing world7, 8, 9. Approximately 3, 89,650 cases
		  occurred in the year 2000 out of which 2, 66,672 were in
		  the oral cavity (ICD – 9 140 – 5) and 1, 22,978 for the
		  cancer of oropharynx (ICD – 9 146, 8-9). This represented
		  about 5{\%} of all cancers for men and 2{\%} for women10.
		  Oral and oropharyngeal cancers remain one of the more
		  common cancers in the South and South East Asian countries,
		  as opposed to Western society, where it accounts for only
		  about 1 – 4{\%} of the of reported cancers incidence 4.
		  For example, the incidence of oral cancer in India is high,
		  constituting about 12{\%} of all cancer in men and 8{\%} in
		  women5; mortality rate is equally high in this population,
		  ranking number one in men and number three in women6. Oral
		  and oropharyngeal cancers therefore qualify as major public
		  health problem, not only in India, but also globally.
		  Worldwide, oral cancer incidence rates appear to have been
		  stabilizing over the last decade12, but the greater
		  frequency of oral cancer in certain regions and among
		  specific populations is a cause for concern since their
		  overall 5-year survival rate is 53{\%} and it has not
		  changed in the last two decades13. With this heightened
		  awareness, research to further investigate the detection,
		  diagnosis and prevention or oral cancer has recently been
		  included as one of the targeted priorities supported by the
		  National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research

		  labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of
		  information in each patient's record. We propose a
		  representation of patients' entire raw EHR records based on
		  the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
		  format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using
		  this representation are capable of accurately predicting
		  multiple medical events from multiple centers without

		  using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical
		  centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at

		  volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945

		  In-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator

		  diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models
		  outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models
		  in all cases. We believe that this approach can be used to
		  create accurate and scalable predictions for a variety of
		  clinical scenarios. In a case study of a particular

		  during the past two decades for breast, prostate,
		  testicular, and colon cancer, while the brain and
		  pancreatic cancers have a much lower median survival rate
		  that has not improved much over the last forty years. This
		  has imposed the challenge of finding gene markers for early
		  cancer detection and treatment strategies. Different
		  methods including regression-based Cox-PH, artificial
		  neural networks, and recently deep learning algorithms have
		  been proposed to predict the survival rate for cancers. We
		  established in this work a novel graph convolution neural
		  network (GCNN) approach called Surv{\_}GCNN to predict the
		  survival rate for 13 different cancer types using the TCGA
		  dataset. For each cancer type, 6 Surv{\_}GCNN models with
		  graphs generated by correlation analysis, GeneMania
		  database, and correlation + GeneMania were trained with and
		  without clinical data to predict the risk score (RS). The
		  performance of the 6 Surv{\_}GCNN models was compared with
		  two other existing models, Cox-PH and Cox-nnet. The results
		  showed that Cox-PH has the worst performance among 8 tested
		  models across the 13 cancer types while Surv{\_}GCNN models
		  with clinical data reported the best overall performance,
		  outperforming other competing models in 7 out of 13 cancer
		  types including BLCA, BRCA, COAD, LUSC, SARC, STAD, and
		  UCEC. A novel network-based interpretation of Surv{\_}GCNN
		  was also proposed to identify potential gene markers for
		  breast cancer. The signatures learned by the nodes in the
		  hidden layer of Surv{\_}GCNN were identified and were
		  linked to potential gene markers by network modularization.
		  The identified gene markers for breast cancer have been
		  compared to a total of 213 gene markers from three widely
		  cited lists for breast cancer survival analysis. About
		  57{\%} of gene markers obtained by Surv{\_}GCNN with

		  treatment. We also found that p38 is downstream of ROS
		  generation induced by K5. On the other hand, staurosporine
		  promotes a sustained activation of p38. We found that p38

  abstract	= {Transendothelial migration is a crucial process of the
		  metastatic cascade in which a malignant cell attaches
		  itself to the endothelial layer forming the inner wall of a
		  blood or lymph vessel and creates a gap through which it
		  enters into the bloodstream (or lymphatic system) and then
		  is transported to distant parts of the body. In this
		  process both biological pathways involving cell adhesion
		  molecules such as VE-cadherin and N-cadherin, and the
		  biophysical properties of the cells play an important role.
		  In this paper, we present one of the first mathematical
		  models considering the problem of cancer cell
		  intravasation. We use an individual force-based multi-scale
		  approach which accounts for intra- and inter-cellular
		  protein pathways and for the physical properties of the
		  cells, and a modelling framework which accounts for the
		  biological shape of the vessel. Using our model, we study
		  the influence of different protein pathways in the
		  achievement of transendothelial migration and give
		  quantitative simulation results comparable with real

  abstract	= {Purpose: Cetuximab, an antibody directed against the EGF
		  receptor, is an effective clinical therapy for patients
		  with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Despite
		  great clinical promise, intrinsic or acquired cetuximab
		  resistance hinders successful treatment outcomes but little
		  is known about the underlying mechanism. Experimental
		  Design: To study the role of oncogenic HRAS in cetuximab
		  resistance in HNSCC, the frequency of oncogenic HRAS
		  mutations was determined in a cohort of 180 genomic DNAs
		  from head and neck cancer specimens. Wealso used a
		  combination of cetuximab-resistant cell lines and a
		  transgenic mouse model of RAS-driven oral cancer to
		  identify an oncogenic RAS-specific gene expression
		  signature that promotes cetuximab resistance. Results:
		  Here, we show that activation of RAS signaling leads to
		  persistent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
		  signaling and consequently to cetuximab resistance. HRAS
		  depletion in cells containing oncogenic HRAS or PIK3CA
		  restored cetuximab sensitivity. In our study, the gene
		  expression signature of c-MYC, BCL-2, BCL-XL, and cyclin D1
		  upon activation of MAPK signaling was not altered by
		  cetuximab treatment, suggesting that this signature may
		  have a pivotal role in cetuximab resistance of
		  RAS-activated HNSCC. Finally, a subset of patients with
		  head and neck cancer with oncogenic HRAS mutations was
		  found to exhibit de novo resistance to cetuximab-based
		  therapy. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings identify
		  a distinct cetuximab resistance mechanism. Oncogenic HRAS
		  in HNSCC promotes activation of ERK signaling, which in
		  turn mediates cetuximab resistance through a specific gene
		  expression signature. {\textcopyright}2014 AACR.},

		  neck dissection in 10 patients with oral squamous cell
		  carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2007 and
		  October 2009, 10 patients underwent primary surgery for the
		  treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.
		  For patients with N0 disease on clinical exam, selective
		  neck dissection (SND [I-III]) was performed. In patients
		  with palpable cervical metastases (N+), modified radical
		  neck dissections were performed, except in one patient in
		  whom SND (I-III) was performed. The histopathologic reports
		  were reviewed to assess the surgical margins, the presence
		  of extra-capsular spread, perineural invasion, and
		  lymphatic invasion. RESULTS: On histopathologic
		  examination, positive soft tissue margins were found in
		  three patients, and regional lymph node metastases were
		  present in five of the ten patients. Perineural invasion
		  was noted in five patients, and extra nodal spread was
		  found in four patients. Regional recurrence was seen in two
		  patients and loco-regional recurrence plus distant
		  metastasis to the tibia was observed in one patient. During
		  the study period, three patients died. Seven patients
		  remain free of disease to date. CONCLUSION:
		  Histopathological evaluation provides important and
		  reliable information for disease staging, treatment
		  planning, and prognosis. The philosophy of neck dissection
		  is evolving rapidly with regard to the selectivity with
		  which at-risk lymph node groups are removed. The sample
		  size in the present study is small, thus, caution should be
		  employed when interpreting these results.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a major
		  cause of cancer death worldwide, which is mainly due to
		  recurrence leading to treatment failure and patient death.
		  Histological status of surgical margins is a currently
		  available assessment for recurrence risk in OSCC; however
		  histological status does not predict recurrence, even in
		  patients with histologically negative margins. Therefore,
		  molecular analysis of histologically normal resection
		  margins and the corresponding OSCC may aid in identifying a
		  gene signature predictive of recurrence. METHODS: We used a
		  meta-analysis of 199 samples (OSCCs and normal oral
		  tissues) from five public microarray datasets, in addition
		  to our microarray analysis of 96 OSCCs and histologically
		  normal margins from 24 patients, to train a gene signature
		  for recurrence. Validation was performed by quantitative
		  real-time PCR using 136 samples from an independent cohort
		  of 30 patients. RESULTS: We identified 138 significantly
		  over-expressed genes ({\textgreater} 2-fold, false
		  discovery rate of 0.01) in OSCC. By penalized likelihood
		  Cox regression, we identified a 4-gene signature with
		  prognostic value for recurrence in our training set. This
		  signature comprised the invasion-related genes MMP1,
		  COL4A1, P4HA2, and THBS2. Over-expression of this 4-gene
		  signature in histologically normal margins was associated
		  with recurrence in our training cohort (p = 0.0003, logrank
		  test) and in our independent validation cohort (p = 0.04,
		  HR = 6.8, logrank test). CONCLUSION: Gene expression
		  alterations occur in histologically normal margins in OSCC.
		  Over-expression of the 4-gene signature in histologically
		  normal surgical margins was validated and highly predictive
		  of recurrence in an independent patient cohort. Our
		  findings may be applied to develop a molecular test, which
		  would be clinically useful to help predict which patients
		  are at a higher risk of local recurrence.},

		  Despite easy access to the oral cavity for cancer

		  Identifying a functional cellular marker may represent a

		  this goal, mechanical phenotyping of individual cells is a
		  novel approach to detect cytoskeletal changes, which are
		  diagnostic for malignant change. The compliance of cells

		  cancer patients was measured using a microfluidic optical
		  stretcher. Cancer cells showed significantly different
		  mechanical behavior, with a higher mean deformability and
		  increased variance. Cancer cells (n approximately 30 cells

  abstract	= {Background: In the era of precision oncology and publicly
		  available datasets, the amount of information available for
		  each patient case has dramatically increased. From clinical
		  variables and PET-CT radiomics measures to DNA-variant and
		  RNA expression profiles, such a wide variety of data
		  presents a multitude of challenges. Large clinical datasets
		  are subject to sparsely and/or inconsistently populated
		  fields. Corresponding sequencing profiles can suffer from
		  the problem of high-dimensionality, where making useful
		  inferences can be difficult without correspondingly large
		  numbers of instances. In this paper we report a novel
		  deployment of machine learning techniques to handle data
		  sparsity and high dimensionality, while evaluating
		  potential biomarkers in the form of unsupervised
		  transformations of RNA data. We apply preprocessing, MICE
		  imputation, and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA)
		  to improve the usability of more than 500 patient cases
		  from the TCGA-HNSC dataset for enhancing future oncological
		  decision support for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
		  (HNSCC). Results: Imputation was shown to improve
		  prognostic ability of sparse clinical treatment variables.
		  SPCA transformation of RNA expression variables reduced
		  runtime for RNA-based models, though changes to classifier
		  performance were not significant. Gene ontology enrichment
		  analysis of gene sets associated with individual sparse
		  principal components (SPCs) are also reported, showing that
		  both high- and low-importance SPCs were associated with
		  cell death pathways, though the high-importance gene sets
		  were found to be associated with a wider variety of
		  cancer-related biological processes. Conclusions: MICE
		  imputation allowed us to impute missing values for
		  clinically informative features, improving their overall
		  importance for predicting two-year recurrence-free survival
		  by incorporating variance from other clinical variables.
		  Dimensionality reduction of RNA expression profiles via
		  SPCA reduced both computation cost and model
		  training/evaluation time without affecting classifier
		  performance, allowing researchers to obtain experimental
		  results much more quickly. SPCA simultaneously provided a
		  convenient avenue for consideration of biological context
		  via gene ontology enrichment analysis.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Alterations on glucose consumption and
		  biosynthetic activity of amino acids, lipids and
		  nucleotides are metabolic changes for sustaining cell
		  proliferation in cancer cells. Irrevocable evidence of this
		  fact is the Warburg effect which establishes that cancer
		  cells prefers glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation to
		  generate ATP. Regulatory action over metabolic enzymes has
		  opened a new window for designing more effective
		  anti-cancer treatments. This enterprise is not trivial and
		  the development of computational models that contribute to
		  identifying potential enzymes for breaking the robustness
		  of cancer cells is a priority.
		  
		  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This work presents a
		  constraint-base modeling of the most experimentally studied
		  metabolic pathways supporting cancer cells: glycolysis, TCA
		  cycle, pentose phosphate, glutaminolysis and oxidative
		  phosphorylation. To evaluate its predictive capacities, a
		  growth kinetics study for Hela cell lines was accomplished
		  and qualitatively compared with in silico predictions.
		  Furthermore, based on pure computational criteria, we
		  concluded that a set of enzymes (such as lactate
		  dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase) perform a pivotal
		  role in cancer cell growth, findings supported by an
		  experimental counterpart.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations on metabolic activity
		  are crucial to initiate and sustain cancer phenotype. In
		  this work, we analyzed the phenotype capacities emerged
		  from a constructed metabolic network conformed by the most
		  experimentally studied pathways sustaining cancer cell
		  growth. Remarkably, in silico model was able to resemble
		  the physiological conditions in cancer cells and
		  successfully identified some enzymes currently studied by
		  its therapeutic effect. Overall, we supplied evidence that
		  constraint-based modeling constitutes a promising
		  computational platform to: 1) integrate high throughput
		  technology and establish a crosstalk between experimental
		  validation and in silico prediction in cancer cell
		  phenotype; 2) explore the fundamental metabolic mechanism
		  that confers robustness in cancer; and 3) suggest new
		  metabolic targets for anticancer treatments. All these
		  issues being central to explore cancer cell metabolism from
		  a systems biology perspective.},

		  that CR-CSCs from different patients have higher Tbeta4

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present
		  a typical biochemical profile of biomarkers: low
		  concentration of beta amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), high
		  concentration of total Tau (t-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau
		  at threonine 181 (p-Tau). Several neurodegenerative
		  diseases may overlap with AD, both in regards to clinical
		  symptoms and neuropathology. Many data suggest that
		  Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology can be identified
		  using biomarkers. It has been hypothesized that subjects
		  with dementia due to AD showed low levels of Abeta1-42
		  combined with the highest levels of total Tau and
		  phosphorylated Tau; moreover, it has been hypothesized that
		  the ratio Abeta1-42:p-Tau further help in discriminating
		  Alzheimer's disease from other diagnoses. The aim of this
		  work is to verify this hypothesis in our cohort of patients
		  and to investigate if the same ratio could be a sensitive
		  index able to discriminate MCI due to neurodegenerative
		  factors (MCId) from MCI due to vascular factors (MCIv).
		  METHODS: Two hundred sixty-two patients meeting the NIA-AA
		  and NINDS-AIREN criteria were diagnosed as follow: AD in
		  120 patients [mean age 71.6 (42 - 87)], FTD in 23 patients
		  [mean age 67.3 (46 - 78)], LBD in 17 patients [mean age
		  73.2 (58 - 83)], VAD in 9 patients [mean age 71.2 (60 -
		  81)]. According to the criteria proposed by Petersen RC, 24
		  patients had the diagnosis of MCId [mean age 71.8 (59 -
		  81)], 38 MCIv [mean age 69.3 (55-82). The comparison
		  between the ratio of Abeta1-42/p-Tau among the six groups
		  was done using t-test for independent samples. A p-value
		  {\textless} 0.05 was considered to represent statistical
		  significance. The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)
		  curve analysis was made using R-studio software. RESULTS:
		  The ratio Abeta1-42:p-Tau was significantly lower in AD and
		  MCId with respect to all the other groups and the
		  difference was also statistically significant between MCId
		  and MCIv. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta1-42:p-Tau ratio has potential
		  for being implemented in the clinical routine for
		  differential diagnosis between AD and other dementias and
		  to distinguish underling pathology such as
		  neurodegenerative or vascular disease.},

		  pathway since treatments with both insulin and Stevia
		  extracts increased the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt.
		  Furthermore, Stevia extracts were able to revert the effect

  abstract	= {Current cancer therapies are based on the ability to
		  inhibit the growth of rapidly dividing cells, the majority
		  of which constitute the tumor. Although for decades,
		  sporadic literature has posited the existence of cancer
		  stem cells (CSCs), only recently has this type of cell been
		  isolated and characterized from solid tumors. Like stem
		  cells from their normal counterpart, CSCs are a rare
		  population that can reconstitute a new tumor with similar
		  composition and phenotype to the tumor of origin. These
		  CSCs represent a small subset of the original tumor, grow
		  indefinitely in vitro, and can form tumors in animals from
		  a very few cells. The cells are slow cycling, capable of
		  self-renewal and give rise to daughter cells that are
		  either self-renewing and pluripotent or transit amplifying,
		  and terminally differentiated. Thus far, CSCs have been
		  isolated from only a small number of tumor types. In most
		  instances, the cells are obtained using selection of, and
		  enrichment for, cells with prospectively identified cell
		  surface markers (Al-Hajj M, et al., 2003). This yields a
		  very limited number of cells, and in many cases these cells
		  cannot be cultured. There is a need for a method for
		  isolation, purification, and expansion of stem cells from a
		  greater spectrum of tumors. There is also evidence for
		  "...a link between normal stem cell regulation and the
		  control of cancer stem cells" (NCI Think Tanks in Cancer
		  Biology, Executive Summary of the Tumor Stem Cell and
		  Self-renewal Genes Think Tank1). We present here a strategy
		  for the isolation and establishment of tumor cell lines
		  that represent a minority of cells in the original tumor.
		  They have the ability to grow indefinitely in vitro, form
		  tumors in mice from less than 100 cells, and share many of
		  the growth requirements and cell surface antigens of normal
		  tissue stem cells from which they may arise.},

  abstract	= {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a poor
		  survival rate mainly due to late stage diagnosis and
		  recurrence. Despite genomic efforts to identify driver
		  mutations and changes in protein-coding gene expression,
		  developing effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
		  remains a priority to guide disease management and improve
		  patient outcome. Recent reports of previously-unannotated
		  microRNAs (miRNAs) from multiple somatic tissues have
		  raised the possibility of HNSCC-specific miRNAs. In this
		  study, we applied a customized in-silico analysis pipeline
		  to identify novel miRNAs from raw small-RNA sequencing
		  datasets from public repositories. We discovered 146
		  previously-unannotated sequences expressed in head and neck
		  samples that share structural properties highly
		  characteristic of miRNAs. The combined expression of the
		  novel miRNAs revealed tissue and context-specific patterns.
		  Furthermore, comparison of tumor with non-malignant tissue
		  samples (n = 43 pairs) revealed 135 of these miRNAs as
		  differentially expressed, most of which were overexpressed
		  or exclusively found in tumor samples. Additionally, a
		  subset of novel miRNAs was significantly associated with
		  HPV infection status and patient outcome. A
		  prognostic-model combining novel and known miRNA was
		  developed (multivariate Cox regression analysis) leading to
		  an improved death and relapse risk stratification (log rank
		  p {\textless} 1e-7). The presence of these miRNAs was
		  corroborated both in an independent dataset and by RT-qPCR
		  analysis, supporting their potential involvement in HNSCC.
		  In this study, we report the discovery of 146 novel miRNAs
		  in head and neck tissues and demonstrate their potential
		  biological significance and clinical relevance to head and
		  neck cancer, providing a new resource for the study of
		  HNSCC.},

  abstract	= {Metabolic control analysis of tumor glycolysis has
		  indicated that hexokinase (HK) and glucose transporter
		  (GLUT) exert the main flux control (71{\%}). To understand
		  why they are the main controlling steps, the GLUT and HK
		  kinetics and the contents of GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4,
		  HKI, and HKII were analyzed in rat hepatocarcinoma AS-30D
		  and HeLa human cervix cancer. An improved protocol to
		  determine the kinetic parameters of GLUT was developed with
		  D-[2-(3)H-glucose] as physiological substrate. Kinetic
		  analysis revealed two components at low- and high-glucose
		  concentrations in both tumor cells. At low glucose and 37
		  degrees C, the V(max) was 55 +/- 20 and 17.2 +/- 6 nmol
		  (min x mg protein)(-1), whereas the K(m) was 0.52 +/- 0.7
		  and 9.3 +/- 3 mM for hepatoma and HeLa cells, respectively.
		  GLUT activity was partially inhibited by cytochalasin B
		  (IC(50) = 0.44 +/- 0.1; K(i) = 0.3 +/- 0.1 microM) and
		  phloretin (IC(50) = 8.7 microM) in AS-30D hepatocarcinoma.
		  At physiological glucose, GLUT1 and GLUT3 were the
		  predominant active isoforms in HeLa cells and AS-30D cells,
		  respectively. HK activity in HeLa cells was much lower (60
		  mU/mg protein) than that in AS-30D cells (700 mU/mg
		  protein), but both HKs were strongly inhibited by G6P. HKII
		  was the predominant isoform in AS-30D carcinoma and HeLa
		  cells. The much lower GLUT V(max) and catalytic efficiency
		  (V(max)/K(m)) values in comparison to those of
		  G6P-sensitive HK suggested the transporter exerts higher
		  control on the glycolytic flux than HK in cancer cells.
		  Thus, GLUT seems a more adequate therapeutic target.},

  abstract	= {Genome-wide mRNA expression measurements can identify
		  molecular signatures of cancer and are anticipated to
		  improve patient management. Such expression profiles are
		  currently being critically evaluated based on an apparent
		  instability in gene composition and the limited overlap
		  between signatures from different studies. We have recently
		  identified a primary tumor signature for detection of lymph
		  node metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
		  Before starting a large multicenter prospective validation,
		  we have thoroughly evaluated the composition of this
		  signature. A multiple training approach was used for
		  validating the original set of predictive genes. Based on
		  different combinations of training samples, multiple
		  signatures were assessed for predictive accuracy and gene
		  composition. The initial set of predictive genes is a
		  subset of a larger group of 825 genes with predictive
		  power. Many of the predictive genes are interchangeable
		  because of a similar expression pattern across the tumor
		  samples. The head and neck metastasis signature has a more
		  stable gene composition than previous predictors. Exclusion
		  of the strongest predictive genes could be compensated by
		  raising the number of genes included in the signature.
		  Multiple accurate predictive signatures can be designed
		  using various subsets of predictive genes. The absence of
		  genes with strong predictive power can be compensated by
		  including more genes with lower predictive power. Lack of
		  overlap between predictive signatures from different
		  studies with the same goal may be explained by the fact
		  that there are more predictive genes than required to
		  design an accurate predictor.},

  abstract	= {The increased glucose metabolism in cancer cells is
		  required to fulfill their high energetic and biosynthetic
		  demands. Changes in the metabolic activity of cancer cells
		  are caused by the activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor
		  suppressors. They can also be part of the metabolic
		  adaptations to the conditions imposed by the tumor
		  microenvironment, such as the hypoxia response. Among the
		  metabolic enzymes that are modulated by these factors are
		  the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases
		  (PFKFBs), a family of bifunctional enzymes that control the
		  levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2). This
		  metabolite is important for the dynamic regulation of
		  glycolytic flux by allosterically activating the
		  rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis phosphofructokinase-1
		  (PFK-1). Therapeutic strategies designed to alter the
		  levels of this metabolite are likely to interfere with the
		  metabolic balance of cancer cells, and could lead to a
		  reduction in cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness and
		  survival. This article will review our current
		  understanding of the role of PFKFB proteins in the control
		  of cancer metabolism and discuss the emerging interest in
		  these enzymes as potential targets for the development of

  abstract	= {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin-dependent glucose influx in
		  skeletal muscle and adipocytes is believed to rely largely
		  on GLUT4, but this has not been confirmed directly. We
		  assessed the relative functional contribution of GLUT4 in
		  experimental models of skeletal muscle and adipocytes using
		  the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir.
		  
		  METHODS: Indinavir (up to 100 micro mol/l) was added to the
		  glucose transport solution after insulin stimulation of
		  wild-type L6 muscle cells, L6 cells over-expressing either
		  GLUT4myc or GLUT1myc, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, isolated mouse
		  brown or white adipocytes, and isolated mouse muscle
		  preparations.
		  
		  RESULTS: 100 micro mol/l indinavir inhibited 80{\%} of both
		  basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in
		  L6GLUT4myc myotubes and myoblasts, but only 25{\%} in
		  L6GLUT1myc cells. Cell-surface density of glucose
		  transporters was not affected. In isolated soleus and
		  extensor digitorum longus muscles, primary white and brown
		  adipocytes, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was inhibited
		  70 to 80{\%} by indinavir. The effect of indinavir on
		  glucose uptake was variable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, averaging
		  45{\%} and 67{\%} inhibition of basal and maximally
		  insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, respectively. In this
		  cell, fractional inhibition of glucose uptake by indinavir
		  correlated positively with the fold-stimulation of glucose
		  uptake by insulin, and was higher with sub-maximal insulin
		  concentrations. The latter finding coincided with an
		  increase only in GLUT4, but not GLUT1, in plasma membrane
		  lawns.
		  
		  CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Indinavir is a useful tool to
		  assess different functional contributions of GLUT4 to
		  glucose uptake in common models of skeletal muscle and
		  adipocytes.},

		  Xenopus laevis oocytes with transport rates similar to that
		  of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), but due to inherent difficulties
		  with GLUT4 expression in oocytes it was uncertain whether
		  GLUT4 transported DHA (Rumsey, S. C. , Kwon, O., Xu, G. W.,
		  Burant, C. F., Simpson, I., and Levine, M. (1997) J. Biol.
		  Chem. 272, 18982-18989). We therefore studied DHA and 2-DG
		  transport in rat adipocytes, which express GLUT4. Without
		  insulin, rat adipocytes transported 2-DG 2-3-fold faster
		  than DHA. Preincubation with insulin (0.67 micrometer)
		  increased transport of each substrate similarly: 7-10-fold
		  for 2-DG and 6-8-fold for DHA. Because intracellular
		  reduction of DHA in adipocytes was complete before and
		  after insulin stimulation, increased transport of DHA was
		  not explained by increased internal reduction of DHA to
		  ascorbate. To determine apparent transport kinetics of
		  GLUT4 for DHA, GLUT4 expression in Xenopus oocytes was
		  reexamined. Preincubation of oocytes for {\textgreater}4 h
		  with insulin (1 micrometer) augmented GLUT4 transport of
		  2-DG and DHA by up to 5-fold. Transport of both substrates
		  was inhibited by cytochalasin B and displayed saturable
		  kinetics. GLUT4 had a higher apparent transport affinity
		  (K(m) of 0.98 versus 5.2 mm) and lower maximal transport
		  rate (V(max) of 66 versus 880 pmol/oocyte/10 min) for DHA
		  compared with 2-DG. The lower transport rate for DHA could
		  not be explained by binding differences at the outer
		  membrane face, as shown by inhibition with ethylidene
		  glucose, or by transporter trans-activation and therefore
		  was probably due to substrate-specific differences in
		  transporter/substrate translocation or release. These novel
		  data indicate that the insulin-sensitive transporter GLUT4
		  transports DHA in both rat adipocytes and Xenopus oocytes.
		  Alterations of this mechanism in diabetes could have
		  clinical implications for ascorbate utilization.},

  abstract	= {Purpose: Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)
		  is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Its
		  endogenous inhibitor (hCaKIIN$\alpha$) is expressed in some
		  cell types. We determined the role of CaMKII in
		  RET-stimulated proliferation and hCaMKIIN$\alpha$ in
		  medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Experimental Design: We
		  analyzed the role of RET mutants on CaMKII activation in
		  NIH3T3 and in MTC cell lines, and determined the effect of
		  CaMKII inhibition on RET/ERK pathway and cell
		  proliferation. Then the expression of hCaKIIN$\alpha$ mRNA
		  was determined by real-time PCR in primary MTC and it was
		  correlated with some clinicopathologic parameters. Results:
		  RETC634Y and RETM918T mutants expressed in NIH3T3 cells
		  induced CaMKII activation. CaMKII was activated in
		  unstimulated MTC cells carrying the same RET mutants and it
		  was inhibited by RET inhibition. Inhibition of CaMKII in
		  these cells induced a reduction of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK
		  phosphorylation, cyclin D expression, and cell
		  proliferation. hCaKIIN$\alpha$ mRNA expression in primary
		  MTC was very variable and did not correlate with gender and
		  age at diagnosis. Serum calcitonin, (R2 = 0.032; P =
		  0.017), tumor volume (P = 0.0079), lymph node metastasis (P
		  = 0.033), and staging (P = 0.0652) were negatively
		  correlated with the hCaKIIN$\alpha$ mRNA expression.
		  Conclusions: CaMKII is activated by RET mutants and is
		  activated at baseline in MTC cells where it mediates the
		  oncogenic pathway leading to cell proliferation. The mRNA
		  expression of its endogenous inhibitor hCaKIIN$\alpha$
		  inversely correlates with the severity of MTC. CaMKII might
		  represent a new target for MTC therapy and hCaKIIN$\alpha$

		  histopathological finding in head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to explore the molecular
		  mechanisms involved in PNI and the role of PNI as an
		  aggressive pathological feature. Materials and methods: We
		  used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to relate the
		  histological presentation of 528 HNSCC tumours to clinical,
		  whole genome expression and proteomic data. Results: We
		  identified a specific gene expression profile highly
		  enriched in genes related to muscle

		  We explored the clinical significance of this profile in
		  three groups of HNSCC tumours stratified according to their
		  low, intermediate or high risk of post-surgical recurrence.
		  In the “low-risk” group, defined as tumours indicated
		  for surgery without adjuvant radiotherapy (n = 51), the PNI
		  gene expression profile identified a subset of HNSCC with a
		  higher rate of tumour recurrence, decreased Disease Free
		  Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) (p {\textless}

		  were observed in “intermediate risk” tumours (n = 112),
		  but not in “high risk” tumours (n = 147), whose
		  prognosis was driven by the presence of lymph node
		  extracapsular spread. Finally, we found that tumours with
		  histological PNI had increased activation levels of the
		  Akt/PKB and mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) kinases.
		  Conclusion: PNI is characterised by a specific gene

		  Analysing the PNI gene expression profile holds potential
		  for therapeutic stratification of HNSCC and identification

		  methylation was validated as a prognostic biomarker in
		  HNSCC patients, identifying patients that potentially
		  benefit from intensified surveillance and/or administration
		  of adjuvant/neodjuvant treatment, i.e.
		  immunotherapy.Background Despite advances in combined
		  modality therapy, outcomes in head and neck squamous cell
		  cancer (HNSCC) remain dismal with five-year overall
		  survival rates of less than 50{\%}. Prognostic biomarkers
		  are urgently needed to identify patients with a high risk
		  of death after initial curative treatment. Methylation
		  status of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor
		  2 (PITX2) has recently emerged as a powerful prognostic
		  biomarker in various cancers. In the present study, the
		  clinical performance of PITX2 methylation was validated in
		  a HNSCC cohort by means of an independent analytical
		  platform (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, Illumina,
		  Inc.). Methods A total of 528 HNSCC patients from The
		  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were included in the study.
		  Death was defined as primary endpoint. PITX2 methylation
		  was correlated with overall survival and
		  clinicopathological parameters. Results PITX2 methylation
		  was significantly associated with sex, tumor site, p16
		  status, and grade. In univariate Cox proportional hazards
		  analysis, PITX2 hypermethylation analyzed as continuous and
		  dichotomized variable was significantly associated with
		  prolonged overall survival of HNSCC patients (continuous:
		  hazard ratio (HR) = 0.19 [95{\%}CI: 0.04±0.88], p = 0.034;
		  dichotomized: HR = 0.52 [95{\%}CI: 0.33±0.84], p = 0.007).
		  In multivariate Cox analysis including established
		  clinicopathological parameters, PITX2 promoter methylation
		  was confirmed as prognostic factor (HR = 0.28 [95{\%}CI:
		  0.09±0.84], p = 0.023).},

@Article{	  sargent2001,
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: In recent years, considerable attention has
		  been given to the development of sophisticated techniques
		  for exploring data sets. One such class of techniques is
		  artificial neural networks (ANNs). Artificial neural
		  networks have many attractive theoretic properties,
		  specifically, the ability to detect non predefined
		  relations such as nonlinear effects and/or interactions.
		  These theoretic advantages come at the cost of reduced
		  interpretability of the model output. Many authors have
		  analyzed the same data set, based on these factors, with
		  both standard statistical methods (such as logistic or Cox
		  regression) and ANN.
		  
		  METHODS: The goal of this work is to review the literature
		  comparing the performance of ANN with standard statistical
		  techniques when applied to medium to large data sets
		  (sample size {\textgreater} 200 patients). A thorough
		  literature search was performed, with specific criteria for
		  a published comparison to be included in this review.
		  
		  RESULTS: In the 28 studies included in this review, ANN
		  outperformed regression in 10 cases (36{\%}), was
		  outperformed by regression in 4 cases (14{\%}), and the 2
		  methods had similar performance in the remaining 14 cases
		  (50{\%}). However, in the 8 largest studies (sample size
		  {\textgreater} 5000), regression and ANN tied in 7 cases,
		  with regression winning in the remaining case. In addition,
		  there is some suggestion of publication bias.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Neither method achieves the desired
		  performance. Both methods should continue to be used and
		  explored in a complementary manner. However, based on the
		  available data, ANN should not replace standard statistical
		  approaches as the method of choice for the classification
		  of medical data.},

		  functions within the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a
		  critical modulator of cell survival. On the basis of
		  promising preclinical data, the safety and tolerability of
		  therapy with the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in combination with
		  radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) was evaluated in this
		  Phase I study.
		  
		  METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients received weekly oral
		  RAD001 in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy,
		  followed by RAD001 in combination with standard adjuvant
		  temozolomide. RAD001 was dose escalated in cohorts of 6
		  patients. Dose-limiting toxicities were defined during
		  RAD001 combination therapy with TMZ/RT.
		  
		  RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled, with a median
		  follow-up of 8.4 months. Combined therapy was well
		  tolerated at all dose levels, with 1 patient on each dose
		  level experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity: Grade 3
		  fatigue, Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, and Grade 4 liver
		  dysfunction. Throughout therapy, there were no Grade 5
		  events, 3 patients experienced Grade 4 toxicities, and 6
		  patients had Grade 3 toxicities attributable to treatment.
		  On the basis of these results, the recommended Phase II
		  dosage currently being tested is RAD001 70 mg/week in
		  combination with standard chemoradiotherapy.
		  Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography scans
		  also were obtained at baseline and after the second RAD001
		  dose before the initiation of TMZ/RT; the change in FDG
		  uptake between scans was calculated for each patient.
		  Fourteen patients had stable metabolic disease, and 4
		  patients had a partial metabolic response.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 in combination with RT/TMZ and adjuvant
		  TMZ was reasonably well tolerated. Changes in tumor
		  metabolism can be detected by FDG positron emission
		  tomography in a subset of patients within days of
		  initiating RAD001 therapy.},

  abstract	= {Depending on the strength of signal dose, CD40 receptor
		  (CD40) controls ERK-1/2 and p38MAPK activation. At low
		  signal dose, ERK-1/2 is maximally phosphorylated but
		  p38MAPK is minimally phosphorylated; as the signal dose
		  increases, ERK-1/2 phosphorylation is reduced whereas
		  p38MAPK phosphorylation is reciprocally enhanced. The
		  mechanism of reciprocal activation of these two MAPKs
		  remains un-elucidated. Here, our computational model,
		  coupled to experimental perturbations, shows that the
		  observed reciprocity is a system-level behavior of an
		  assembly of kinases arranged in two modules. Experimental
		  perturbations with kinase inhibitors suggest that a minimum
		  of two trans-modular negative feedback loops are required
		  to reproduce the experimentally observed reciprocity. The
		  bi-modular architecture of the signaling pathways endows
		  the system with an inherent plasticity which is further
		  expressed in the skewing of the CD40-induced productions of
		  IL-10 and IL-12, the respective anti-inflammatory and
		  pro-inflammatory cytokines. Targeting the plasticity of
		  CD40 signaling significantly reduces Leishmania major
		  infection in a susceptible mouse strain. Thus, for the
		  first time, using CD40 signaling as a model, we show how a

		  family of proteins, is ubiquitously expressed in normal

		  integrity and provide resistance against stress. Vimentin
		  is overexpressed in various epithelial cancers, including
		  prostate cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, tumors of the
		  central nervous system, breast cancer, malignant melanoma,
		  and lung cancer. Vimentin's overexpression in cancer
		  correlates well with accelerated tumor growth, invasion,

		  from diagnosis to prediction of treatment outcomes. These
		  methods have also been used to predict gene mutations from

		  Through its interpretable design, HE2RNA provides virtual

		  CD20-staining on an independent dataset. The transcriptomic
		  representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on

  annote	= {Preprocessing of whole-slide images. The application of

		  challenging problem, particularly due to the high
		  dimensionality of the data (up to 100,000 × 100,000 pixels
		  for a single whole-slide image) and the small size of
		  available datasets. We divided the whole-slide images into
		  squares of 112 × 112 $\mu$m (224 × 224 pixels) called
		  “tiles”, and used the Otsu algorithm62 (as implemented
		  in python package skimage) to select only those containing

  abstract	= {The glucose transporter GLUT8 cycles between intracellular
		  vesicles and the plasma membrane. Like the
		  insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4, GLUT8 is
		  primarily located in intracellular compartments under basal
		  conditions. Whereas translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma
		  membrane is stimulated by insulin, the distribution of
		  GLUT8 is not affected by insulin treatment in adipose
		  cells. However, blocking endocytosis by co-expression of a
		  dominant-negative dynamin GTPase (K44A) or mutation of the
		  N-terminal dileucine (LL(12/13)) motif in GLUT8 leads to
		  accumulation of the glucose transporter at the cell surface
		  in a variety of different cell types. Yeast two-hybrid
		  analyses and GST pulldown assays reveal that the LL signal
		  constitutes a binding site for the beta2-adaptin subunit of
		  the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex, implicating this
		  motif in targeting of GLUT8 to clathrin-coated vesicles.
		  Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays provide evidence that the
		  binding site for the LL motif maps to the appendage domain
		  of beta2-adaptin. To analyze the biological significance of
		  the LL/beta2 interaction, we utilized RNA interference to
		  specifically knockdown AP-2. Our results show that
		  RNAi-mediated targeting of the mu2 subunit leads to
		  cellular depletion of AP-2, but not AP-1 adaptor complexes
		  in HeLa cells. As a consequence, GLUT8 accumulates at the
		  plasma membrane at comparable levels to those observed in
		  K44A-transfected cells. Conversely, the intracellular
		  localization of mutant GLUT8-LL/AA is restored by replacing
		  the LL motif in GLUT8 with the transferrin receptor-derived
		  mu2-adaptin binding motif YTRF, indicating that for
		  endocytosis both AP-2 binding motifs can substitute for
		  each other. Thus, our data demonstrate that recruitment of
		  GLUT8 to the endocytic machinery occurs via direct
		  interaction of the dileucine motif with beta2-adaptin, and
		  that endocytosis might be the main site at which GLUT8 is
		  likely to be regulated.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The MapReduce framework enables a scalable
		  processing and analyzing of large datasets by distributing
		  the computational load on connected computer nodes,
		  referred to as a cluster. In Bioinformatics, MapReduce has
		  already been adopted to various case scenarios such as
		  mapping next generation sequencing data to a reference
		  genome, finding SNPs from short read data or matching
		  strings in genotype files. Nevertheless, tasks like
		  installing and maintaining MapReduce on a cluster system,
		  importing data into its distributed file system or
		  executing MapReduce programs require advanced knowledge in
		  computer science and could thus prevent scientists from
		  usage of currently available and useful software solutions.
		  RESULTS: Here we present Cloudgene, a freely available
		  platform to improve the usability of MapReduce programs in
		  Bioinformatics by providing a graphical user interface for
		  the execution, the import and export of data and the
		  reproducibility of workflows on in-house (private clouds)
		  and rented clusters (public clouds). The aim of Cloudgene
		  is to build a standardized graphical execution environment
		  for currently available and future MapReduce programs,
		  which can all be integrated by using its plug-in interface.
		  Since Cloudgene can be executed on private clusters,
		  sensitive datasets can be kept in house at all time and
		  data transfer times are therefore minimized. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Our results show that MapReduce programs can be integrated
		  into Cloudgene with little effort and without adding any
		  computational overhead to existing programs. This platform
		  gives developers the opportunity to focus on the actual
		  implementation task and provides scientists a platform with
		  the aim to hide the complexity of MapReduce. In addition to
		  MapReduce programs, Cloudgene can also be used to launch
		  predefined systems (e.g. Cloud BioLinux, RStudio) in public
		  clouds. Currently, five different bioinformatic programs
		  using MapReduce and two systems are integrated and have
		  been successfully deployed. Cloudgene is freely available

  abstract	= {Purpose: The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HNSCCs is
		  highly immunosuppressive. Tumor derived exosomes are key
		  mediators of many pro-tumorigenic effects and exhibit
		  strong immunosuppressive properties. So far, this has been
		  established for T cells and other leukocyte populations,
		  but the effects of exosomes on B cells remain to be
		  elucidated. Here we show that exosomes purified from the
		  plasma of HNSCC patients modify the phenotype of B cells.
		  Methods: : Exosomes were isolated from plasma of HNSCC
		  patients by mini size exclusion chromatography. B cells
		  were purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors by
		  LeukoSep and CD19-negative selection and co-cultured with
		  HNSCC exosomes. Using flow cytometry, the expression of
		  checkpoint receptors was determined. Adenosine production
		  was assessed by luciferase assay. The activity of the B
		  cell receptor (BCR) pathway was inferred by measuring the
		  expression of phosphorylated Bruton's tyrosine kinase
		  (p-BTK). Results: Co-cultivation with HNSCC exosomes
		  inhibited cluster formation of stimulated B cells. This was
		  accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the
		  co-stimulatory checkpoint receptor GITR and CD39, an
		  ATP-hydrolyzing ectoenzyme. In line with this, ATP
		  hydrolysis and adenosine production by exosome-treated B
		  cells were decreased. Furthermore, the expression of p-BTK
		  was reduced. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that
		  exosomes derived from HNSCC patients have direct effects on
		  B cells in vitro. We suspect a global inhibitory effect;
		  since exosomes inhibited cluster formation; reduced the
		  expression of a co-stimulatory receptor and decreased the
		  activity of the BCR pathway.},

  abstract	= {Tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$-converting enzyme (TACE) is
		  responsible for the shedding of cell surface TNF. Studies
		  suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate
		  up-regulation of TACE activity by direct oxidization or
		  modification of the protein. However, these investigations
		  have been largely based upon nonphysiological stimulation
		  of promonocytic cell lines which may respond and process
		  TACE differently from primary cells. Furthermore,
		  investigators have relied upon TACE substrate shedding as a
		  surrogate for activity quantification. We addressed these
		  concerns, employing a direct, cell-based fluorometric assay
		  to investigate the regulation of TACE catalytic activity on
		  freshly isolated primary human monocytes during LPS
		  stimulation. We hypothesized that ROS mediate up-regulation
		  of TACE activity indirectly, by activation of intracellular
		  signaling pathways. LPS up-regulated TACE activity rapidly
		  (within 30 min) without changing cell surface TACE
		  expression. Scavenging of ROS or inhibiting their
		  production by flavoprotein oxidoreductases significantly
		  attenuated LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation.
		  Exogenous ROS (H2O2) also up-regulated TACE activity with
		  similar kinetics and magnitude as LPS. H2O2- and
		  LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation were effectively
		  abolished by a variety of selective p38 MAPK inhibitors.
		  Activation of p38 was redox-sensitive as H2O2 caused p38
		  phosphorylation, and ROS scavenging significantly reduced
		  LPS-induced phospho-p38 expression. Inhibition of the p38
		  substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, completely
		  attenuated TACE activity up-regulation, whereas inhibition
		  of ERK had little effect. Lastly, inhibition of cell
		  surface oxidoreductases prevented TACE activity
		  up-regulation distal to p38 activation. In conclusion, our
		  data indicate that in primary human monocytes, ROS mediate
		  LPS-induced up-regulation of TACE activity indirectly
		  through activation of the p38 signaling pathway.},

		  interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, to reactivate
		  the immune system to eradicate the host tumor. Methods: Pts
		  with recurrent/metastatic H/N cancer were enrolled in this
		  multi-center, non-randomized trial in two cohorts (HPV and

		  expression by immunohistochemistry (22C3), and if positive
		  allowed to proceed with treatment of single agent MK-3475
		  given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 wks. Primary
		  objectives are to determine (1) safety and tolerability and
		  (2) anti-tumor activity of MK-3475 assessed by RECIST 1.1.
		  Secondary objectives include progression-free survival,
		  overall survival and response duration. Results: All
		  results are based on preliminary, unaudited data as of Jan.
		  27, 2014. 77.9{\%} of patients expressed PD-L1, defined as

		  3, and 7 had ≥4 prior regimens of treatment (5 unknown).
		  Of the patients treated with MK-3475, 78.3{\%} experienced
		  ≥1 AE, and 46.7{\%} reported a drug-related (DR) AE. The
		  most common DR AEs reported were pruritis (6, 10{\%}),

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: c-Src inhibition in cancer cells leads to an
		  abrogation of invasion but a variable effect on apoptosis.
		  The pathways downstream of c-Src promoting survival are not
		  well characterized. Because cancer therapy that both
		  decreases invasion and induces significant apoptosis would
		  be ideal, we sought to characterize the mechanisms of
		  resistance to c-Src inhibition.
		  
		  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: c-Src was inhibited in a panel of oral
		  cancer cell lines and subsequent survival and signaling
		  measured. The interactions between c-Src and c-Met were
		  evaluated using immunoprecitation and an in vitro kinase
		  assay. Cytotoxicity was measured and the Chou-Talalay
		  combination index calculated. An orthotopic model of oral
		  cancer was used to assess the effects of c-Met and c-Src
		  inhibitors.
		  
		  RESULTS: Inhibition of c-Src resulted in c-Met inhibition
		  in sensitive cells lines, but not in resistant cell lines.
		  Isolated c-Met was a c-Src substrate in both sensitive and
		  resistant cells, but there was no interaction of c-Src and
		  c-Met in intact resistant cells. To examine the biological
		  consequences of this mechanism, we demonstrated synergistic
		  cytotoxicity, enhanced apoptosis, and decreased tumor size
		  with the combination of c-Src and c-Met inhibitors.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Sustained c-Met activation can mediate
		  resistance to c-Src inhibition. These data suggest that the
		  differences between c-Met and c-Src signaling in sensitive
		  and resistant cells are due to distinct factors promoting

  abstract	= {The ubiquitously expressed family of alpha-actinins
		  bridges actin filaments to stabilize adhesions, a process
		  disrupted during growth factor-induced migration of cells.
		  During the dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton, actinins
		  are phosphorylated on tyrosines, although the consequences
		  of this are unknown. We expressed the two isoforms of human
		  alpha-actinin in murine fibroblasts that express human
		  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and found that both
		  alpha-actinin 1 (ACTN1) and alpha-actinin 4 (ACTN4) were
		  phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after stimulation with
		  EGF, although ACTN4 was phosphorylated to the greater
		  extent. This required the activation of Src
		  protein-tyrosine kinase and p38-MAPK (and phosphoinositide
		  trisphosphate kinase in part) but not MEK/ERK or Rac1, as
		  determined by inhibitors. The EGF-induced phosphorylation
		  sites of ACTN4 were mapped to tyrosine 4, the major site,
		  and tyrosine 31, the minor one. Truncation mutagenesis
		  showed that the C-terminal domains of ACTN4 (amino acids
		  300-911), which cross-link the actin binding head domains,
		  act as an inhibitory domain for both actin binding and
		  EGF-mediated phosphorylation. These two properties were
		  mutually exclusive; removal of the C terminus enhanced
		  actin binding of ACTN4 mutants while limiting EGF-induced
		  phosphorylation, and conversely EGF-stimulated
		  phosphorylation of ACTN4 decreased its affinity to actin.
		  Interestingly, a phosphomimetic of tyrosine 265 (which can
		  be found in carcinoma cells and lies near the K255E
		  mutation that causes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis)
		  demonstrated increased actin binding activity and
		  susceptibility of ACTN4 to calpain-mediated cleavage; this
		  variant also retarded cell spreading. Remarkably, either
		  treatment of cells with low concentrations of latrunculin
		  A, which has been shown to depolymerize F-actin, or the
		  deletion of the actin binding domain (100-252 amino acids)
		  of ACTN4Y265E restored EGF-induced phosphorylation. An
		  F-actin binding assay in vitro showed that Y4E/Y31E, a
		  mimetic of diphosphorylated ACTN4, bound F-actin slightly
		  compared with wild type (WT). Importantly, the EGF-mediated
		  phosphorylation of ACTN4 at tyrosine 4 and 31 significantly
		  inhibited multinucleation of proliferating NR6WT
		  fibroblasts that overexpress ACTN4. These results suggest
		  that EGF regulates the actin binding activity of ACTN4 by
		  inducing tyrosyl-directed phosphorylation.},

		  Background: Oral submucous fibrosis is an oral potentially
		  malignant disorder with high incidence of malignant
		  transformation and rising global prevalence. However, the
		  genesis of oral submucous fibrosis is still unclear despite
		  superfluity of literature. In the background of ineffective
		  treatment, it is necessary to decode its onset and
		  progression before designing customized treatment regimens.
		  Objective: The objective of this article is to decipher the
		  pathogenesis of oral submucous fibrosis in order to
		  identify novel drug targets. Methods: A thorough literature
		  review based on oral submucous fibrosis being an
		  overhealing wound was conducted; several related patents
		  were identified and herewith reviewed. Necessary pathways
		  were elaborated and deliberated in the manuscript in the
		  form of schemas, keeping our hypothesis in mind. Several
		  novel molecular targets were identified and discussed in
		  detail. Results: Several patents demonstrating inhibition
		  of fibrosis via chemokine ligand mimetics, anticon-nexon
		  antibodies, stem cell therapy, fibronectin blocking
		  peptides, HIF inhibitors, recombinant erythropoietin,
		  xanthine oxidase inhibitors, long non-coding RNAs,
		  targeting inflammation, increasing TH-1/TH-2 cytokine
		  ratio, t-box protein 4, chromium containing compositions,
		  Iron-based nanocomposites, Lactate Dehydrogenase-5
		  inhibitors, Carbonic Anhdrase-9 inhibitors, proton pump
		  inhibitors, liposomal encapsulated glutathione,
		  monocarboxylate-4 inhibitors, autophagy inhibitors,
		  Submucosal anti-IL-6 antibodies, fibrin degradation
		  products for monitoring of malignancy and fibrosis, small
		  molecule antagonists like vorapaxar, tiplaxtinin, and
		  TM-5275, TGF-$\beta$ signalling inhibitors were identified
		  as future therapeutic avenues. Conclusion: Considering,
		  oral submucous fibrosis as an overhealing wound explains
		  both pathogenesis and malignant transformation. Certainly,
		  abnormalities in coagulation and fibrinolytic system are a
		  common denominator in the profibrotic milieu and associated
		  malignancy.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Traditional influenza surveillance relies on
		  influenza-like illness (ILI) syndrome that is reported by
		  health care providers. It primarily captures individuals
		  who seek medical care and misses those who do not.
		  Recently, Web-based data sources have been studied for
		  application to public health surveillance, as there is a
		  growing number of people who search, post, and tweet about
		  their illnesses before seeking medical care. Existing
		  research has shown some promise of using data from Google,
		  Twitter, and Wikipedia to complement traditional
		  surveillance for ILI. However, past studies have evaluated
		  these Web-based sources individually or dually without
		  comparing all 3 of them, and it would be beneficial to know
		  which of the Web-based sources performs best in order to be
		  considered to complement traditional methods. OBJECTIVE:
		  The objective of this study is to comparatively analyze
		  Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia by examining which best
		  corresponds with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
		  (CDC) ILI data. It was hypothesized that Wikipedia will
		  best correspond with CDC ILI data as previous research
		  found it to be least influenced by high media coverage in
		  comparison with Google and Twitter. METHODS: Publicly
		  available, deidentified data were collected from the CDC,
		  Google Flu Trends, HealthTweets, and Wikipedia for the
		  2012-2015 influenza seasons. Bayesian change point analysis
		  was used to detect seasonal changes, or change points, in
		  each of the data sources. Change points in Google, Twitter,
		  and Wikipedia that occurred during the exact week, 1
		  preceding week, or 1 week after the CDC's change points
		  were compared with the CDC data as the gold standard. All
		  analyses were conducted using the R package "bcp" version
		  4.0.0 in RStudio version 0.99.484 (RStudio Inc). In
		  addition, sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV)
		  were calculated for Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia.
		  RESULTS: During the 2012-2015 influenza seasons, a high
		  sensitivity of 92{\%} was found for Google, whereas the PPV
		  for Google was 85{\%}. A low sensitivity of 50{\%} was
		  calculated for Twitter; a low PPV of 43{\%} was found for
		  Twitter also. Wikipedia had the lowest sensitivity of
		  33{\%} and lowest PPV of 40{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 3
		  Web-based sources, Google had the best combination of
		  sensitivity and PPV in detecting Bayesian change points in
		  influenza-related data streams. Findings demonstrated that
		  change points in Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia data
		  occasionally aligned well with change points captured in
		  CDC ILI data, yet these sources did not detect all changes
		  in CDC data and should be further studied and developed.},

  abstract	= {Background. Controversy exists over the predictive value
		  of the presence and pattern of tumor invasion of the
		  mandible in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Many
		  authors have questioned increasing the classification of
		  small tumors to T4 on the basis of mandibular invasion
		  alone. There are little data on the influence of the
		  pattern of invasion on prognosis. Methods. We prospectively
		  reviewed 100 consecutive mandibular resections for
		  previously untreated oral SCC. Clinical and pathologic data
		  collected included details of soft and hard tissue
		  histologic findings. Outcomes included recurrence (local,
		  regional, and distant metastases), disease-specific
		  survival, and death from other causes. The median follow-up
		  for survivors was 65 months. Results. Of 100 cases, 65
		  involved segmental and 35 involved marginal resections.
		  Sixty-two percent of mandibles were invaded by tumor. Local
		  recurrence occured in 21{\%} and was strongly correlated
		  with tumor size, nodal involvement, and pattern of soft
		  tissue invasion. The 5-year disease-specific survival was
		  68{\%}, and the crude survival was 50{\%}. Mandibular
		  invasion predicted for recurrence and disease-specific
		  survival, even after correcting for the effects of other
		  variables. The pattern of mandibular invasion
		  (erosive/infiltrative) was also predictive for recurrence
		  and disease-specific survival. Conclusions. Even in the
		  presence of mandibular invasion, soft tissue factors are
		  the most important determinants of prognosis. Upstaging
		  tumors on the basis of mandibular invasion is justified. An
		  infiltrative pattern of bone invasion is a marker of
		  aggressive tumor biology and should be included in the pTNM
		  classification. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals Inc.},

  abstract	= {Background: DNA methylation has started a recent
		  revolution in genomics biology by identifying key
		  biomarkers for multiple cancers, including oral squamous
		  cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: A multi-stage screening
		  strategy was used to identify DNA-methylation-based
		  signatures for OSCC prognosis. We used The Cancer Genome
		  Atlas (TCGA) data as training set which were validated in
		  two independent datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus
		  (GEO). The correlation between DNA methylation and
		  corresponding gene expression and the prognostic value of
		  the gene expression were explored as well. Results: The
		  seven DNA methylation CpG sites were identified which were
		  significantly associated with OSCC overall survival.
		  Prognostic signature, a weighted linear combination of the
		  seven CpG sites, successfully distinguished the overall
		  survival of OSCC patients and had a moderate predictive
		  ability for survival [training set: hazard ratio (HR)=3.23,
		  P=5.52×10-10, area under the curve (AUC)=0.76; validation
		  set 1: HR=2.79, P=0.010, AUC=0.67; validation set 2:
		  HR=3.69, P=0.011, AUC=0.66]. Stratification analysis by
		  human papillomavirus status, clinical stage, age, gender,
		  smoking status, and grade retained statistical
		  significance. Expression of genes corresponding to
		  candidate CpG sites (AJAP1, SHANK2, FOXA2, MT1A, ZNF570,
		  HOXC4, and HOXB4) was also significantly associated with
		  patient's survival. Signature integrating of DNA
		  methylation, gene expression, and clinical information
		  showed a superior ability for prognostic prediction
		  (AUC=0.78). Conclusion: Prognostic signature integrated of
		  DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinical information
		  provides a better prognostic prediction value for OSCC
		  patients than that with clinical information only.},

		  biomarker for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).
		  DKK1 may be a promising strategy for the future treatment
		  of LSCC metastasis and recurrence. OBJECTIVES: DKK1 is
		  reportedly involved in the metastasis and invasion of
		  several tumor types. This study aimed to investigate the
		  prognostic value of DKK1 in LSCC. METHODS: DKK1 expression
		  was measured in Hep-2 cell lines, as well as in tumor and
		  peritumoral tissues, using quantitative real-time PCR and
		  western blot analyses. The role of DKK1 in LSCC was
		  investigated by depleting DKK1 using small interfering
		  RNAs. Tissue microarrays of 102 LSCC patient samples were
		  employed to immunohistochemically detect expression of
		  DKK1, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), and
		  $\beta$-catenin. Prognostic significance was assessed using
		  Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: DKK1 expression
		  was elevated in the Hep-2 cell line and tumor samples. DKK1
		  depletion decreased cell proliferation, migration, and
		  invasiveness. High DKK1 expression was significantly
		  associated with T and clinical stage, lymph node
		  metastasis, and tumor size (p {\textless} 0.05). Increased
		  DKK1 levels in LSCC tissues correlated with elevated VEGF-C
		  and $\beta$-catenin. Multivariate analyses revealed that
		  DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor of overall survival.},

		  Immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic response prediction
		  In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been
		  proven to be a promising therapy for various cancers.
		  Inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
		  and CTLA-4 may enhance antitumor immunity, while tumor
		  immune escape restricts the application of immune
		  checkpoint blockade. The computational method of Tumor
		  Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) modeled immune
		  escape in tumors with distinct levels of cytotoxic T
		  lymphocytes by using both T cell dysfunction and exclusion
		  signatures [27]. In this current study, TIDE was used to
		  predict clinical responses of HNSC to immune checkpoint
		  inhibitors by website tools (http://tide.dfci.harvard.edu).
		  Chemotherapy is an important method to treat HNSC,
		  therefore the “pRRophetic” package was employed for the
		  prediction of chemotherapeutic response, quantified by the
		  half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each HNSC
		  patient [28, 29]. These results were compared between the

		  analysis is shown to accurately capture a three phase
		  metabolic behavior that is observed experimentally during
		  oncogenic progression, as well as a prominent
		  characteristic of cancer cells involving their preference

  abstract	= {Summary Objective To describe trends in country and
		  sex-specific incidence rates of head and neck cancer (HNC),
		  focusing on changes across calendar periods. Materials and
		  Methods Sex and country specific rates of HNC were
		  calculated for 1998–2002 and 1983–1987 using
		  population-based registry data assembled by the Cancer
		  Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) data system for 83
		  registries representing 35 countries. HNCs were categorized
		  into three groups: oral cavity (including tongue and
		  mouth), oropharynx (including tonsil and oropharynx) and
		  other HNC (including larynx and poorly-specified tumors of
		  the lip/oral cavity/pharynx). Age-standardized rates per
		  100,000 persons were calculated using the 1960 world
		  standard population. Changes in rates between 1998–2002
		  and 1993–1987 were assessed. Results During these periods
		  there was substantial global variation in HNC incidence
		  trends by cancer site, country/registry and sex. Rates of
		  oral cavity cancer increased among men and women in some
		  European and Asian countries (Czech Republic, Slovak
		  Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the United Kingdom and
		  Japan). In France and Italy, rates declined among men but
		  increased among women. Oral cavity incidence rates declined
		  among men and women in many Asian registries as well as in
		  Canada and the United States. Oropharyngeal cancer rates
		  increased among both men and women in a number of European
		  countries (Belarus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
		  Iceland, Latvia, Norway and the United Kingdom) whereas
		  they declined in some Asian countries. The largest increase
		  in oropharyngeal rates was among Brazilian men. Rates of
		  other HNCs varied substantially by country and sex.
		  Conclusion From 1983–1987 to 1998–2002, trends in HNC
		  rates differed by subtype, country and sex. Oral cavity
		  cancer incidence rates increased in many countries with
		  tobacco epidemics that are currently peaking and declined
		  in areas where tobacco use peaked some time ago. In
		  contrast, rates of oropharyngeal cancer increased in a
		  number of countries where tobacco use has declined, perhaps
		  due to the emerging importance of human papillomavirus
		  infection. Continued monitoring of trends in incidence
		  rates is needed to inform global cancer prevention
		  strategies.},

		  transporter isoform? What is it about GLUT3 that
		  specifically suits the needs of the highly metabolic and
		  oxidative neuron with its high glucose demand? More
		  recently, GLUT3 has been studied in other cell types with
		  quite specific requirements for glucose, including sperm,

		  in tobacco use. We aimed to analyze the frequency of p53
		  mutations in oral cancer patients from Gujarat, India and
		  their effect on clinico-pathological features, local
		  recurrence and survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS: p53 mutation
		  analysis was performed on 46 paired tissue samples
		  (adjacent normal and primary malignant) using PCR-SSCP and
		  sequencing. RESULTS: Sequencing confirmed 51 p53 mutations
		  in 46 paired tissues. Three novel mutations (frameshift
		  deletion in exon 4; G{\textgreater}T transversion at codon
		  117 in exon 4 and G{\textgreater}A transition at codon 319
		  in exon 9) were identified. Distinct pattern of p53
		  mutations was observed: more common C{\textgreater}T
		  transitions and recurring mutation sites at codon 90 and
		  116 in exon 4. Interestingly, the probability of developing
		  recurrence was higher in small tumors ({\textless}4 cm)
		  with p53 mutations and in cases with p53 mutations in both
		  adjacent normal and malignant tissues. A significant low
		  disease free survival and overall survival was observed in

  abstract	= {Background: Gingivo-buccal squamous cell carcinoma (GBSCC)
		  is one of the most common oral cavity cancers in India with
		  less than 50{\%} patients surviving past 5 years. Here, we
		  report a whole transcriptome profile on a batch of GBSCC
		  tumours with diverse tobacco usage habits. The study
		  provides an entire landscape of altered expression with an
		  emphasis on searching for targets with therapeutic
		  potential. Methods: Whole transcriptomes of 12 GBSCC
		  tumours and adjacent normal tissues were sequenced and
		  analysed to explore differential expression of genes.
		  Expression changes were further compared with those in TCGA
		  head and neck cohort (n = 263) data base and validated in
		  an independent set of 10GBSCC samples. Results:
		  Differentially expressed genes (n = 2176) were used to
		  cluster the patients based on their tobacco habits,
		  resulting in 3 subgroups. Immune response was observed to
		  be significantly aberrant, along with cell adhesion and
		  lipid metabolism processes. Different modes of immune
		  evasion were seen across 12 tumours with up-regulation or
		  consistent expression of CD47, unlike other immune evasion
		  genes such as PDL1, FUT4, CTLA4 and BTLA which were
		  downregulated in a few samples. Variation in infiltrating
		  immune cell signatures across tumours also indicates
		  heterogeneity in immune evasion strategies. A few
		  actionable genes such as ITGA4, TGFB1 and PTGS1/COX1 were
		  over expressed in most samples. Conclusion: This study
		  found expression deregulation of key immune evasion genes,
		  such as CD47 and PDL1, and reasserts their potential as
		  effective immunotherapeutic targets for GBSCC, which
		  requires further clinical studies. Present findings
		  reiterate the idea of using transcriptome profiling to
		  guide precision therapeutic strategies.},

		  a univariate model, high-risk category tumors had a
		  significantly higher rate of recurrence and death due to
		  recurrence compared with low/intermediate-risk categories
		  (P=0.000 and P=0.047, respectively). Controlling for margin

		  were used to construct tissue microarrays (TMAs), which
		  were stained with EGFR, p16, DAPI and Pan-cytokeratin, and

  abstract	= {Purpose The primary cause of death due to head and neck
		  squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is local treatment failure.
		  The goal of this study was to examine this phenomenon using
		  an unbiased approach. Experimental design We utilized
		  HPV-negative cell lines rendered radiation resistant (RR)
		  via repeated exposure to radiation, a panel of HPV-negative
		  HNSCC cell lines and three cohorts of HPV-negative HNSCC
		  tumors (n=68, 97, {\&} 114) from patients treated with
		  radiotherapy and subjected to genomic, transcriptomic and
		  proteomic analysis. Results RR cell lines exhibited
		  up-regulation of several proteins compared to controls,
		  including increased activation of Axl and PI3 kinase
		  signaling as well as increased expression of PD-L1.
		  Additionally, inhibition of either Axl or PI3 kinase led to
		  decreased PD-L1 expression. When clinical samples were
		  subjected to RPPA and mRNA expression analysis in separate
		  cohorts, PD-L1 was correlated with both Axl and PI3K
		  signaling as well as dramatically associated with local
		  failure following radiotherapy. This finding was confirmed
		  examining a third cohort using immunohistochemistry.
		  Indeed, tumors with high expression of PD-L1 had failure
		  rates following radiotherapy of 60{\%}, 70{\%} and 50{\%}
		  compared to 20{\%}, 25{\%} and 20{\%} in the PD-L1 low
		  expression group (p=0.01, 1.9×10−3 and 9×10−4
		  respectively). This finding remained significant on
		  multivariate analysis in all groups. Additionally, those
		  patients with PD-L1 low/CD8+TILs high had no local failure
		  or death due to disease (p=5×10−4 and p=4×10−4
		  respectively). Conclusions Taken together, our data point
		  to a targetable Axl-PI3 kinase-PD-L1 axis that is highly

  abstract	= {Objective: We recently showed that tumors with an
		  immunologically ‘cold' phenotype are enriched for
		  expression of stemness-associated genes and PVR/CD155, the
		  ligand of the immunosuppressive molecule TIGIT. To explore
		  the therapeutic implications of this finding, we
		  investigated the relationship between PVR/CD155 expression,
		  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and prognosis in
		  high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) and other cancers.
		  Methods: Expression of CD155, TIGIT, PD-1, PD-L1, and other
		  immune markers in HGSC was assessed by high-dimensional
		  flow cytometry, multi-color histological imaging, and/or
		  gene expression profiling. The prognostic significance of
		  PVR/CD155 and CD274/PD-L1 expression was assessed
		  bioinformatically in HGSC and 32 other cancers in The
		  Cancer Genome Atlas. Results: T cells from HGSC frequently
		  co-expressed TIGIT and PD-1, and the ratio of TIGIT to PD-1
		  expression increased markedly after in vitro expansion with
		  a clinically relevant protocol. CD155 was commonly
		  expressed on malignant epithelium in HGSC and showed a
		  negative or non-significant association with TIL. In
		  contrast, PD-L1 was predominantly expressed by
		  tumor-associated macrophages and positively associated with
		  TIL. These contrasts between CD155 and PD-L1 were seen
		  across HGSC patients, across metastatic sites within
		  individual patients, and even within individual tumor
		  deposits. PVR/CD155 and CD274/PD-L1 exhibited divergent
		  prognostic associations across diverse cancer types in

		  contrasting expression patterns, TIL associations and

		  non-redundant immunosuppressive mechanisms. The CD155/TIGIT
		  pathway represents a compelling immunotherapeutic target

		  to test for differentially expressed KIF genes. Patients
		  were divided into high-and low-expression groups according
		  to the median expression values of each KIF genes. Survival
		  data were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard
		  model. Comprehensive survival analysis was performed to

		  Results: Bioinformatics analysis showed that all KIF genes
		  were significantly enriched during DNA replication and the
		  cell cycle, and co-expressed with each other. Thirteen KIF
		  genes were differentially expressed in cancer and adjacent
		  tissues, and high levels of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and

		  and success in checkpoint blockade using antibodies for the
		  treatment of certain cancers, immunotherapy has become one
		  of the hottest areas in cancer research, with promise of
		  long-lasting therapeutic effect. Currently, however, only a
		  proportion of cancers have a good response to checkpoint
		  inhibition immunotherapy. Better understanding of the
		  cancer response and resistance mechanisms is essential to
		  fully explore the potential of immunotherapy to cure the
		  majority of cancers. Bladder cancer, one of the most common
		  and aggressive malignant diseases, has been successfully
		  treated both at early and advanced stages by different
		  immunotherapeutic approaches, bacillus
		  Calmette–Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) intravesical instillation and
		  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, respectively.
		  Therefore, it provides a good model to investigate cancer
		  immune response mechanisms and to improve the efficiency of
		  immunotherapy. Here, we review bladder cancer immunotherapy
		  with equal weight on BCG and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies and
		  demonstrate why and how bladder cancer can be used as a
		  model to study the predictors and mechanisms of cancer
		  immune response and shine light on further development of

		  to improve immunotherapy of bladder cancer and other
		  malignancies. We review the success of BCG and

		  briefly the adaptation of immunotherapy approaches and

		  cancer as a model to investigate cancer immune response
		  mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches, which may be

  abstract	= {Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a
		  method for increasing both the length and quality of life
		  for over 500 years. Experimental work confirming the
		  success of this approach in animals has accumulated over
		  the last 100 years. Lifelong caloric restriction (CR) may
		  extend life by up to 50{\%} in rodents, with progressively
		  less impact the later in life it is started. This effect is
		  matched by profound impacts on age related diseases
		  including reduced risk of cancer, neurodegenerative
		  disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and
		  type II diabetes mellitus. The disposable soma theory of
		  ageing suggests that CR evolved as a somatic protection
		  response to enable animals to survive periods of food
		  shortage. The shutdown of reproductive function during CR
		  is consistent with this suggestion, but other features of
		  the phenomenon are less consistent with this theory, and
		  some have suggested that in rodents it may be mostly an
		  artifact of domestication. CR induces profound effects on
		  animals at all levels from the transcriptome to whole
		  animal physiology and behavior. Animals under CR lose
		  weight which is disproportionately contributed to by white
		  adipose tissue. Generally animals on CR change their
		  activity patterns so that they are more active prior to
		  food delivery each day but total activity may be unchanged
		  or reduced. Considerable debate has occurred over the
		  effects of CR on resting metabolic rate (RMR). Total RMR
		  declines, but as body mass and body composition also change
		  it is unclear whether metabolism at the tissue level also
		  declines, is unchanged or even increases. Body temperature
		  universally decreases. Hunger is increased and does not
		  seem to abate even with very long term restriction.
		  Circulating adipokines are reduced reflecting the reduction
		  in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass under restriction and
		  there is a large reduction in circulating insulin and
		  glucose levels. There are profound tissue level changes in
		  metabolism with a generalized shift from carbohydrate to
		  fat metabolism. Four pathways have been implicated in
		  mediating the CR effect. These are the insulin like growth
		  factor (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin
		  pathway, the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated
		  protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the target of rapamycin
		  (TOR) pathway. These different pathways may interact and
		  may all play important roles mediating different aspects of
		  the response. Exactly how they generate the health benefits
		  remains open for debate, however CR results in reduced
		  oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy, both of which
		  could be essential components of the beneficial effects.
		  Most data about the effects of CR in mammals comes from
		  work on rodents. There is limited work on non-human
		  primates that shows promising effects and one randomized
		  controlled trial in humans where physiological markers of
		  the CR response are consistent with the responses in mice
		  and rats. There are also populations of humans voluntarily
		  restricting themselves. Humans on long term restriction
		  report similar negative side effects to those observed in
		  animals - perpetual hunger, reduced body temperature
		  leading to a feeling of being cold, and diminished libido.
		  Considerable effort has been directed in recent years to
		  find drugs that mimic the CR response. Promising candidates
		  are those that intersect with the critical signaling
		  pathways identified above and include biguanides such as
		  metformin that target the insulin signaling pathway,
		  stilbenes (e.g. resveratrol) that affect sirtuin activity
		  and drugs such as rapamycin that interact with mTOR
		  signaling. Whether it will ever be possible to find drugs
		  that capture the health benefits of CR without the negative
		  side-effects remains unclear. Moreover, even if such drugs
		  are developed how the current licensing system for drug use
		  in western societies would cope with them may be a further
		  obstacle to their use.},

		  distribution of GLUT4 itself. In the basal state, domains
		  (clusters) of GLUT4 molecules in PM are created by an
		  exocytosis that retains GLUT4 at the fusion site.
		  Surprisingly, when insulin induces a burst of GLUT4
		  exocytosis, it does not merely accelerate this basal
		  exocytosis but rather stimulates approximately 60-fold
		  another mode of exocytosis that disperses GLUT4 into PM. In
		  contradistinction, internalization of most GLUT4,

		  via the subsequent recruitment of clathrin. The data fit a

  abstract	= {In the early 1900s, George Crile recognized that cancer of
		  the head and neck was primarily a locoregional disease and
		  felt that patients could be cured if the cancer was
		  completely excised. The cervical lymph nodes were
		  recognized as the initial area of spread and so the best
		  chance for cure was excision of the primary cancer sites in
		  concert with the ipsilateral cervical soft tissue. 1 He
		  described and popularized radical neck dissections for the
		  treatment of regionally metastatic head and neck cancer.
		  Crile's radical neck dissection remained the standard of
		  care for cervical metastases for almost 70 years.
		  Modifications of the traditional radical neck dissection
		  came after 1963, when Suarez demonstrated that the
		  nonlymphatic structures (sternocleidomastoid muscle and
		  internal jugular vein) were anatomically separated by
		  fascia from the lymph nodes. Oncologic outcomes were found
		  to be similar to radical neck dissections, and the
		  functional and aesthetic outcomes of patients were clearly
		  superior. 2 3 4 In addition, particularly with the advent
		  of radiation therapy, preservation of the
		  sternocleidomastoid muscle was found to protect the carotid
		  artery from subsequent damage and potential blowout. 5
		  Several classification schemes for a neck dissection were
		  introduced, and in an effort to present a common language
		  the Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology of the
		  American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery
		  introduced the most widely accepted classification system
		  in 1991. A modified radical neck dissection was defined as
		  “the excision of all lymph nodes routinely removed by the
		  radical neck dissection, with preservation of one or more
		  non-lymphatic structures.” 6 Key Operative Learning
		  Points • Modified radical neck dissection is strictly
		  defined as the removal of lymph nodes from levels 1 to 5
		  while preserving one or more of the nonlymphatic structures
		  (sternocleidomastoid muscle, spinal accessory nerve,
		  internal jugular vein). • Decisions to perform a modified
		  radical neck dissection are often made intraoperatively,
		  when those nonlymphatic structures are found to be involved
		  with cancer. • Preservation of the spinal accessory nerve
		  maintains normal shoulder function. • Neck dissections
		  can be done safely when the surgeon has thorough knowledge
		  of the anatomy. • Soft tissue in level 4 should be
		  clamped and ligated to prevent chyle leaks. •
		  Manipulation of the carotid artery can cause excessive
		  stimulation of the carotid body reflex, resulting in
		  bradycardia and hypotension. This can be resolved with
		  injection of lidocaine directly into the carotid sinus. •
		  When approaching the carotid sheath, it is important to
		  keep the plane of dissection over the jugular vein to
		  prevent inadvertent damage to the sympathetic trunk, vagus
		  nerve, or carotid artery.},
  annote	= {Common Errors in Technique  •  Failure to both tie and
		  suture ligate the internal jugular vein stump may result in
		  slipping of the silk tie off the vascular stump.  •  If
		  the marginal mandibular nerve is not identified during the
		  elevation of the skin flap, it can be easily injured during
		  subsequent dissection.},

  abstract	= {GLUT4 is an insulin-regulated glucose transporter that is
		  responsible for insulin-regulated glucose uptake into fat
		  and muscle cells. In the absence of insulin, GLUT4 is
		  mainly found in intracellular vesicles referred to as GLUT4
		  storage vesicles (GSVs). Here, we summarise evidence for
		  the existence of these specific vesicles, how they are
		  sequestered inside the cell and how they undergo exocytosis
		  in the presence of insulin. In response to insulin
		  stimulation, GSVs fuse with the plasma membrane in a rapid
		  burst and in the continued presence of insulin GLUT4
		  molecules are internalised and recycled back to the plasma
		  membrane in vesicles that are distinct from GSVs and
		  probably of endosomal origin. In this Commentary we discuss
		  evidence that this delivery process is tightly regulated
		  and involves numerous molecules. Key components include the
		  actin cytoskeleton, myosin motors, several Rab GTPases, the
		  exocyst, SNARE proteins and SNARE regulators. Each step in
		  this process is carefully orchestrated in a sequential and
		  coupled manner and we are beginning to dissect key nodes
		  within this network that determine vesicle-membrane fusion
		  in response to insulin. This regulatory process clearly
		  involves the Ser/Thr kinase AKT and the exquisite manner in
		  which this single metabolic process is regulated makes it a
		  likely target for lesions that might contribute to
		  metabolic disease.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Recently, the availability of high-resolution
		  microscopy together with the advancements in the
		  development of biomarkers as reporters of biomolecular
		  interactions increased the importance of imaging methods in
		  molecular cell biology. These techniques enable the
		  investigation of cellular characteristics like volume, size
		  and geometry as well as volume and geometry of
		  intracellular compartments, and the amount of existing
		  proteins in a spatially resolved manner. Such detailed
		  investigations opened up many new areas of research in the
		  study of spatial, complex and dynamic cellular systems. One
		  of the crucial challenges for the study of such systems is
		  the design of a well stuctured and optimized workflow to
		  provide a systematic and efficient hypothesis verification.
		  Computer Science can efficiently address this task by
		  providing software that facilitates handling, analysis, and
		  evaluation of biological data to the benefit of
		  experimenters and modelers.
		  
		  RESULTS: The Spatio-Temporal Simulation Environment (STSE)
		  is a set of open-source tools provided to conduct
		  spatio-temporal simulations in discrete structures based on
		  microscopy images. The framework contains modules to
		  digitize, represent, analyze, and mathematically model
		  spatial distributions of biochemical species. Graphical
		  user interface (GUI) tools provided with the software
		  enable meshing of the simulation space based on the Voronoi
		  concept. In addition, it supports to automatically acquire
		  spatial information to the mesh from the images based on
		  pixel luminosity (e.g. corresponding to molecular levels
		  from microscopy images). STSE is freely available either as
		  a stand-alone version or included in the linux live
		  distribution Systems Biology Operational Software (SB.OS)
		  and can be downloaded from http://www.stse-software.org/.
		  The Python source code as well as a comprehensive user
		  manual and video tutorials are also offered to the research
		  community. We discuss main concepts of the STSE design and
		  workflow. We demonstrate it's usefulness using the example
		  of a signaling cascade leading to formation of a
		  morphological gradient of Fus3 within the cytoplasm of the
		  mating yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: STSE is an efficient and powerful novel
		  platform, designed for computational handling and
		  evaluation of microscopic images. It allows for an
		  uninterrupted workflow including digitization,
		  representation, analysis, and mathematical modeling. By
		  providing the means to relate the simulation to the image
		  data it allows for systematic, image driven model
		  validation or rejection. STSE can be scripted and extended
		  using the Python language. STSE should be considered rather
		  as an API together with workflow guidelines and a
		  collection of GUI tools than a stand alone application. The
		  priority of the project is to provide an easy and intuitive
		  way of extending and customizing software using the Python
		  language.},

		  so, a measure of statistical significance called the q
		  value is associated with each tested feature. The q value
		  is similar to the well known p value, except it is a
		  measure of significance in terms of the false discovery
		  rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach
		  avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a
		  more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome

  abstract	= {CONTEXT: GLUT4 is the predominant glucose transporter
		  isoform expressed in fat and muscle. In GLUT4 null mice,
		  insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle was
		  diminished but not eliminated, suggesting that another
		  insulin-sensitive system was present. OBJECTIVE: This study
		  was intended to determine whether insulin caused GLUT12
		  translocation in muscle. DESIGN: Six normal volunteers had
		  muscle biopsies before and after euglycemic insulin
		  infusions. SETTING: Infusions and biopsies were performed
		  in an outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were
		  nonobese, young adults with no family history of diabetes.
		  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GLUT12, GLUT4, and GLUT1 proteins
		  were quantified in muscle biopsy fractions. Cultured
		  myoblasts were used to determine whether GLUT12
		  translocation was phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase
		  (PI3-K)-dependent. INTERVENTION: Insulin was infused at 40
		  mU/m(2) x min for 3 h. RESULTS: In human muscle, insulin
		  caused a shift of a portion of GLUT12 from intracellular
		  low-density microsomes to the plasma membrane (PM) fraction
		  (17{\%} in PM at baseline, 38{\%} in PM after insulin).
		  Insulin increased GLUT4 in PM from 13 to 42{\%}. GLUT1 was
		  predominantly in the PM fractions at baseline and did not
		  change significantly after insulin. L6 myoblasts in culture
		  also expressed and translocated GLUT12 in response to
		  insulin, but inhibiting PI3-K prevented the translocation
		  of GLUT12 and GLUT4. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin causes GLUT12 to
		  translocate from an intracellular location to the plasma
		  membrane in normal human skeletal muscle. Translocation of
		  GLUT12 in cultured myoblasts was dependent on activation of
		  PI3-K. GLUT12 may have evolutionarily preceded GLUT4 and
		  now provides redundancy to the dominant GLUT4 system in
		  muscle.},

		  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates glucose and
		  lipid metabolism via the phosphorylation and subsequent
		  inactivation of its downstream target acetyl-CoA
		  carboxylase (ACC).Thus, we analyzed the expression of pAMPK
		  and its downstream target phosphorylated acetyl-CoA
		  carboxylase (pACC), as well as their impact on the survival
		  of patients with resected SCCHN. METHODS: One hundred
		  eighteen patients with surgically resected SCCHN were
		  enrolled. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for pAMPK and
		  pACC was performed using tissue microarrays of operative
		  specimens of SCCHN. The expression was divided into two or
		  three groups according to the IHC score [pAMPK: negative
		  (0), positive (1-3); pACC: negative (0), low expression (1,
		  2), and high expression (3)]. Statistical analysis was
		  performed to determine the association of pAMPK expression
		  with clinicopathological features and pACC and pErk
		  expression. RESULTS: The positive rates of pAMPK and pACC
		  expression were 64.4{\%} (76/118) and 68.6{\%} (81/118),
		  respectively. pAMPK was significantly higher in patients
		  aged younger than 60 years (P = 0.024; $\chi$2 test) and
		  those with early-stage (T1/T2; P = 0.02; $\chi$2 test) and
		  oral cavity (P = 0.026; Fisher's exact test) tumors. In
		  multivariate analysis, pAMPK expression was not
		  significantly correlated with overall survival (OS)
		  (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.66; 95{\%} confidence
		  interval [CI]: 0.35-1.23), whereas high pACC expression was
		  independently associated with worse OS in node-positive
		  patients (adjusted HR: 17.58; 95{\%} CI: 3.50-88.18).
		  CONCLUSIONS: Strong expression of pACC was found to be an
		  independent prognostic marker for patients with
		  node-positive SCCHN. Our results suggest that pACC may play
		  a role in tumor progression of SCCHN and may help to
		  identify patient subgroups at high risk for poor disease

  abstract	= {It is increasingly apparent that cancer development
		  depends not only on genetic alterations, but also on
		  epigenetic changes involving histone modifications. GASC1,
		  member of the histone demethylases affecting
		  heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression,
		  has been found to be dysregulation in many types of cancers
		  including breast cancer, prostate cancer, metastatic lung
		  sarcomatoid carcinoma, and leukemia. In this study, we
		  examined the expression of GASC1 and certain GASC1-targeted
		  genes (KLF4, MYC, SOX2, PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG) and
		  identified a three-gene prognostic signature (PPARG, MDM2,
		  and NANOG), using risk scores based on immunohistochemical
		  analyses of 149 tumor specimens from patients with
		  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The presence of
		  a high-risk three-gene signature in the ESCC tumors was
		  significantly associated with decreased overall survival
		  (OS) of the patients. We validated the predictive value of
		  the three-gene signature in a second independent cohort of
		  101 patients with ESCC in order to determine whether it had
		  predictive value. The results were similar to those in 149
		  patients. According to multivariate Cox proportional
		  hazards analyses, the predictive model of a three-gene
		  signature was an independent predictor for OS
		  (p = 0.005 in cohort 1, p = 0.025 in cohort 2). In
		  addition, ROC analysis indicated that the predictive
		  ability of the three-gene model was more robust than that
		  of a single biomarker. Therefore, our three-gene signature
		  is closely associated with OS among patients with ESCC and
		  may serve as a predictor for the poor prognosis of ESCC
		  patients.},

  abstract	= {The combination of irradiated fibroblast feeder cells and
		  Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, conditionally induces an
		  indefinite proliferative state in primary mammalian
		  epithelial cells. These conditionally reprogrammed cells
		  (CRCs) are karyotype-stable and nontumorigenic. Because
		  self-renewal is a recognized property of stem cells, we
		  investigated whether Y-27632 and feeder cells induced a
		  stem-like phenotype. We found that CRCs share
		  characteristics of adult stem cells and exhibit
		  up-regulated expression of $\alpha$6 and $\beta$1
		  integrins, $\Delta$Np63$\alpha$, CD44, and telomerase
		  reverse transcriptase, as well as decreased Notch signaling
		  and an increased level of nuclear $\beta$-catenin. The
		  induction of CRCs is rapid (occurs within 2 d) and results
		  from reprogramming of the entire cell population rather
		  than the selection of a minor subpopulation. CRCs do not
		  overexpress the transcription factor sets characteristic of
		  embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (e.g., Sox2,
		  Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4). The induction of CRCs is also
		  reversible, and removal of Y-27632 and feeders allows the
		  cells to differentiate normally. Thus, when CRCs from
		  ectocervical epithelium or tracheal epithelium are placed
		  in an air-liquid interface culture system, the cervical
		  cells form a well differentiated stratified squamous
		  epithelium, whereas the tracheal cells form a ciliated
		  airway epithelium. We discuss the diagnostic and
		  therapeutic opportunities afforded by a method that can
		  generate adult stem-like cells in vitro without genetic

		  isoform of the retinoic acid receptor beta, termed beta
		  prime. Beta prime lacks the N-terminal domains of beta 2

		  prime is able to heterodimerize and interact with
		  transcription cofactors. To determine the effects of
		  different retinoic acid receptor isoforms on cell

		  sensitive (MCF7) and retinoid-resistant (MDA-MB-231) cells
		  with retinoic acid receptor beta 2, beta 4, or beta prime.
		  Expression of the truncated beta prime isoform induces
		  resistance to retinoic acid treatment in retinoid sensitive
		  MCF7 cells. In both retinoid sensitive and resistant cells,
		  expression of full-length beta 2 and beta 4 isoforms
		  results in elevated sensitivity to retinoic acid treatment
		  and caspase-independent cell death. Cell death in beta 4
		  transduced MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied by metaphase
		  chromosome decondensation and breakage suggestive of
		  mitotic catastrophe. Our results provide evidence that: (a)
		  the truncated form of the retinoic acid receptor beta

  abstract	= {Cetuximab remains to date the only targeted therapy
		  approved for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (HNSCC). The EGFR pathway plays a key role in the
		  tumorigenesis and progression of this disease as well as in
		  the resistance to radiotherapy (RT). While several
		  anti-EGFR agents have been tested in HNSCC, cetuximab, an
		  IgG1 subclass monoclonal antibody against EGFR, is the only
		  drug with proven efficacy for the treatment of both
		  locoregionally-advanced (LA) and recurrent/metastatic (R/M)
		  disease. The addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy is a
		  validated treatment option in LA-HNSCC. However, its use
		  has been limited to patients who are considered unfit for
		  standard of care chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with single agent
		  cisplatin given the lack of direct comparison of these two
		  regimens in randomized phase III trials and the inferiority
		  suggested by metanalysis and phase II studies. The current
		  use of cetuximab in HNSCC is about to change given the
		  recent results from randomized prospective clinical trials
		  in both the LA and R/M setting. Two phase III studies
		  evaluating RT-cetuximab vs. CRT in Human Papillomavirus
		  (HPV)-positive LA oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
		  (De-ESCALaTE and RTOG 1016) showed inferior overall
		  survival and progression-free survival for RT-cetuximab
		  combination, and therefore CRT with cisplatin remains the
		  standard of care in this disease. In the R/M HNSCC, the
		  EXTREME regimen has been the standard of care as first-line
		  treatment for the past 10 years. However, the results from
		  the KEYNOTE-048 study will likely position the anti-PD-1
		  agent pembrolizumab as the new first line treatment either
		  alone or in combination with chemotherapy in this setting
		  based on PD-L1 status. Interestingly, cetuximab-mediated
		  immunogenicity through antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity
		  (ADCC) has encouraged the evaluation of combined approaches
		  with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in both LA and R/M-HNSCC
		  settings. This article reviews the accumulated evidence on
		  the role of cetuximab in HNSCC in the past decade, offering
		  an overview of its current impact in the treatment of LA
		  and R/M-HNSCC disease and its potential use in the era of
		  immunotherapy.},

		  (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] proposed the concept of field
		  cancerization in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of
		  the head and neck (HNSCC) and discussed its clinical
		  significance for the development of second primary tumors
		  and local recurrences. To define the process of field
		  cancerization and its putative clinical implications, we
		  analyzed genetic aberrations in HNSCC and the accompanying
		  macroscopically normal mucosa. In 28 HNSCC patients, loss
		  of heterozygosity was determined in tumor and five
		  noncontiguous mucosal biopsies using eight microsatellite
		  markers at 9p, 3p, and 17p. For patients who showed loss of
		  heterozygosity in their mucosal biopsies, all margins of
		  the surgical specimen were subsequently analyzed to
		  determine the extension of the field. In these cases,
		  additional markers at 8p, 13q, and 18q as well as p53
		  mutations were included to determine subclonal differences
		  between field and tumor. Genetically altered fields were
		  detected in 36{\%} (10 of 28) of the HNSCC patients. The
		  field varied in size between patients and consisted of
		  genetically different subclones. In 7 of 10 cases, the
		  field extended into the surgical margins. One particular
		  patient with a genetically altered field in a surgical
		  margin developed a local recurrence after 28 months of
		  follow-up. Microsatellite analysis showed that this
		  recurrence had more molecular markers in common with the
		  nonresected premalignant field than with the original
		  tumor, suggesting that this persistent field has progressed
		  further into a new malignancy. Our data show that
		  genetically altered mucosa remains after treatment in a
		  significant proportion of HNSCC patients, which may explain
		  in part the high frequency of local recurrences and second
		  primary tumors. Adequate identification and risk assessment
		  of these genetically altered fields may have profound
		  implications for future patient management.},

  abstract	= {Tumor cell populations have been recently proposed to be
		  composed of two compartments: tumor-initiating cells
		  characterized by a slow and asymmetrical growth, and the
		  "differentiated" cancer cells with a fast and symmetrical
		  growth. Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells (CICs)
		  play a crucial role in tumor recurrence. The resistance of
		  CICs to drugs and irradiation often allows them to survive
		  traditional therapy. NK cells are potent cytotoxic
		  lymphocytes that can recognize tumor cells. In this study,
		  we have analyzed the NK cell recognition of tumor target
		  cells derived from the two cancer cell compartments of
		  colon adenocarcinoma lesions. Our data demonstrate that
		  freshly purified allogeneic NK cells can recognize and kill
		  colorectal carcinoma-derived CICs whereas the non-CIC
		  counterpart of the tumors (differentiated tumor cells),
		  either autologous or allogeneic, is less susceptible to NK
		  cells. This difference in the NK cell susceptibility
		  correlates with higher expression on CICs of ligands for
		  NKp30 and NKp44 in the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)
		  group of activating NK receptors. In contrast, CICs express
		  lower levels of MHC class I, known to inhibit NK
		  recognition, on their surface than do the "differentiated"
		  tumor cells. These data have been validated by confocal
		  microscopy where NCR ligands and MHC class I molecule
		  membrane distribution have been analyzed. Moreover, NK cell
		  receptor blockade in cytotoxicity assays demonstrates that

  abstract	= {UNLABELLED: Although 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
		  kinase-1 (PDK1) has been predominately linked to the
		  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, it may also
		  evoke additional signaling outputs to promote
		  tumorigenesis. Here, we report that PDK1 directly induces
		  phosphorylation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which in turn
		  induces MYC phosphorylation and protein accumulation. We
		  show that PDK1-PLK1-MYC signaling is critical for cancer
		  cell growth and survival, and small-molecule inhibition of
		  PDK1/PLK1 provides an effective approach for therapeutic
		  targeting of MYC dependency. Intriguingly, PDK1-PLK1-MYC
		  signaling induces an embryonic stem cell-like gene
		  signature associated with aggressive tumor behaviors and is
		  a robust signaling axis driving cancer stem cell (CSC)
		  self-renewal. Finally, we show that a PLK1 inhibitor
		  synergizes with an mTOR inhibitor to induce synergistic
		  antitumor effects in colorectal cancer by antagonizing
		  compensatory MYC induction. These findings identify a novel
		  pathway in human cancer and CSC activation and provide a
		  therapeutic strategy for targeting MYC-associated

		  SIGNIFICANCE: This work identifies PDK1–PLK1-MYC

		  necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10C (TNFRSF10C)
		  copy number variation (CNV) with distant metastatic disease
		  in patients with CRC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
		  METHODS: Genetic sequencing data and clinical
		  characteristics were obtained from TCGA for all available
		  patients with CRC. There were 515 CRC patient samples with
		  CNV and clinical outcome data, including a subset of 144
		  rectal adenocarcinoma patient samples. Using the TCGA CRC
		  dataset, CNV of TNFRSF10C was evaluated for association
		  with distant metastatic disease (M1 vs. M0). Multivariate
		  logistic regression analysis with odds ratio (OR) using a
		  95{\%} confidence interval (CI) was performed adjusting for
		  age, T stage, N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, gender,
		  microsatellite instability (MSI), location, and surgical
		  margin status. RESULTS: TNFRSF10C CNV in patients with CRC
		  was associated with distant metastatic disease [OR 4.81
		  (95{\%} CI, 2.13-10.85) P{\textless}0.001] and positive

		  stage, N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, gender, and MSI,
		  TNFRSF10C CNV remained significantly associated with
		  distant metastatic disease (OR P=0.018). Subset analysis
		  revealed that TNFRSF10C CNV was also significantly
		  associated with distant metastatic disease in patients with
		  rectal adenocarcinoma (OR P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: TNFRSF10C
		  CNV in patients with CRC is associated with distant

		  signaling molecules and play certain roles in tumor
		  progression. To assess the anti-oxidative role of
		  endogenous T$\beta$4 in tumor cells, its expression in
		  SW480 cells was knocked down by a shRNA, which induced
		  significant increases of ROS. Interestingly, some
		  cristae-lost and several electron-dense mitochondria
		  appeared in cells with T$\beta$4 knockdown that was
		  accompanied by a marked decline of the membrane potential
		  of these organelles. Strikingly, while the ATP and lactate
		  levels in SW480 cells were notably elevated by T$\beta$4
		  downregulation, this treatment significantly diminished the
		  mitochondrial DNA copy number and protein levels of several
		  subunits of the electron transport complexes. Finally,
		  immunofluorescent staining results suggested the presence
		  of T$\beta$4 in mitochondria. To the best of our knowledge,

		  The presence of a robust antitumor milieu characterized by

		  containment by the immune system and can even lead to tumor

		  microenvironment are also potential therapeutic targets,
		  and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/ PD-L1
		  axis are especially promising. FDA-approved indications for
		  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 are rapidly expanding across numerous tumor

  abstract	= {The ability to take up and metabolize glucose at the
		  cellular level is a property shared by the vast majority of
		  existing organisms. Most mammalian cells import glucose by
		  a process of facilitative diffusion mediated by members of
		  the Glut (SLC2A) family of membrane transport proteins.
		  Fourteen Glut proteins are expressed in the human and they
		  include transporters for substrates other than glucose,
		  including fructose, myoinositol, and urate. The primary
		  physiological substrates for at least half of the 14 Glut
		  proteins are either uncertain or unknown. The
		  well-established glucose transporter isoforms, Gluts 1-4,
		  are known to have distinct regulatory and/or kinetic
		  properties that reflect their specific roles in cellular
		  and whole body glucose homeostasis. Separate review
		  articles on many of the Glut proteins have recently
		  appeared in this journal. Here, we provide a very brief
		  summary of the known properties of the 14 Glut proteins and
		  suggest some avenues of future investigation in this
		  area.},

@Article{	  thorsson2018,
  abstract	= {We performed an extensive immunogenomic analysis of more
		  than 10,000 tumors comprising 33 diverse cancer types by
		  utilizing data compiled by TCGA. Across cancer types, we
		  identified six immune subtypes—wound healing,
		  IFN-$\gamma$ dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte depleted,
		  immunologically quiet, and TGF-$\beta$
		  dominant—characterized by differences in macrophage or
		  lymphocyte signatures, Th1:Th2 cell ratio, extent of
		  intratumoral heterogeneity, aneuploidy, extent of
		  neoantigen load, overall cell proliferation, expression of
		  immunomodulatory genes, and prognosis. Specific driver
		  mutations correlated with lower (CTNNB1, NRAS, or IDH1) or
		  higher (BRAF, TP53, or CASP8) leukocyte levels across all
		  cancers. Multiple control modalities of the intracellular
		  and extracellular networks (transcription, microRNAs, copy
		  number, and epigenetic processes) were involved in
		  tumor-immune cell interactions, both across and within
		  immune subtypes. Our immunogenomics pipeline to
		  characterize these heterogeneous tumors and the resulting
		  data are intended to serve as a resource for future
		  targeted studies to further advance the field. Thorsson et
		  al. present immunogenomics analyses of more than 10,000
		  tumors, identifying six immune subtypes that encompass
		  multiple cancer types and are hypothesized to define immune
		  response patterns impacting prognosis. This work provides a
		  resource for understanding tumor-immune interactions, with
		  implications for identifying ways to advance research on
		  immunotherapy.},

		  identified through a weighted gene co-expression network
		  analysis (WGCNA). Gene expression profiles and clinical
		  data of GSE25066 were obtained from the Gene Expression
		  Omnibus (GEO) database. The result was validated with

		  highest intramodule connectivity were selected as the core
		  genes (R(2) = 0.40). RESULTS: According to TCGA and
		  Oncomine datasets, seven genes were selected as candidate
		  hub genes. Following further experimental verification,
		  four hub genes (FAM171A1, NDFIP1, SKP1, and REEP5) were
		  retained. CONCLUSION: We identified four hub genes as
		  candidate biomarkers for BRCA. These hub genes may provide

  abstract	= {Part of the cellular response to toxins, physical stresses
		  and inflammatory cytokines occurs by signalling via the
		  stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 reactivating
		  kinase pathways. This results in modification of cellular
		  gene expression. These stress-responsive kinase pathways
		  are structurally similar, but functionally distinct, from
		  the archetypal mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs or
		  ERKs). The ERK pathway is a hierarchical cascade
		  originating at the cell membrane with receptors for
		  mitogens or growth factors, which recruit, via adapter
		  proteins and exchange factors, the small guanosine
		  triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras (see fig. 1). Ras activates
		  raf, a serine threonine kinase, which activates MEK
		  (MAPK/ERK kinase). MEK, in turn, phosphorylates and
		  activates ERK1 and ERK2, which translocate to the nucleus
		  and transactivate transcription factors, changing gene
		  expression to promote growth, differentiation or mitosis.
		  By transducing signals through a cascade of kinases,
		  several options for control are introduced for amplifying
		  and/or modifying the output signal. The SAPK and p38
		  pathways are also hierarchically arranged, but less is
		  known about the upstream components and the downstream
		  effects of stimulation of these pathways. Among the
		  processes modulated by stress-responsive pathways are
		  apoptosis, transformation, development, immune activation,
		  inflammation and adaptation to environmental changes. This
		  review outlines the upstream componentry of these pathways
		  that interact with a variety of agonists to modify the
		  activity of SAPK and p38, and explores the downstream

  abstract	= {Background The availability of high-throughput omics
		  datasets from large patient cohorts has allowed the
		  development of methods that aim at predicting patient
		  clinical outcomes, such as survival and disease recurrence.
		  Such methods are also important to better understand the
		  biological mechanisms underlying disease etiology and
		  development, as well as treatment responses. Recently,
		  different predictive models, relying on distinct algorithms
		  (including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) have
		  been investigated. In this context, deep learning
		  strategies are of special interest due to their
		  demonstrated superior performance over a wide range of
		  problems and datasets. One of the main challenges of such
		  strategies is the “small n large p” problem. Indeed,
		  omics datasets typically consist of small numbers of
		  samples and large numbers of features relative to typical
		  deep learning datasets. Neural networks usually tackle this
		  problem through feature selection or by including
		  additional constraints during the learning process. Methods
		  We propose to tackle this problem with a novel strategy
		  that relies on a graph-based method for feature extraction,
		  coupled with a deep neural network for clinical outcome
		  prediction. The omics data are first represented as graphs
		  whose nodes represent patients, and edges represent
		  correlations between the patients' omics profiles.
		  Topological features, such as centralities, are then
		  extracted from these graphs for every node. Lastly, these
		  features are used as input to train and test various
		  classifiers. Results We apply this strategy to four
		  neuroblastoma datasets and observe that models based on
		  neural networks are more accurate than state of the art
		  models (DNN: 85{\%}-87{\%}, SVM/RF: 75{\%}-82{\%}). We
		  explore how different parameters and configurations are
		  selected in order to overcome the effects of the small data
		  problem as well as the curse of dimensionality. Conclusions
		  Our results indicate that the deep neural networks capture
		  complex features in the data that help predicting patient
		  clinical outcomes.},

  abstract	= {Purpose: Although cetuximab, an anti-EGF receptor (EGFR)
		  monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for patients
		  with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC),
		  its clinical use is limited by onset of resistance.
		  Experimental Design: We characterized two colorectal cancer
		  models to study the mechanisms of acquired resistance to
		  cetuximab. Results: Following chronic treatment of nude
		  mice bearing cetuximab-sensitive human GEO colon
		  xenografts, cetuximab-resistant GEO (GEO-CR) cells were
		  obtained. In GEO-CR cells, proliferation and survival
		  signals were constitutively active despite EGFR inhibition
		  by cetuximab treatment. Whole gene expression profiling
		  identified a series of genes involved in the hepatocyte
		  growth factor (HGF)-MET-dependent pathways, which were
		  upregulated in GEO-CR cells. Furthermore, activated,
		  phosphorylated MET was detected in GEO-CR cells. A second
		  colorectal cancer cell line with acquired resistance to
		  cetuximab was obtained (SW48-CR). Inhibition of MET
		  expression by siRNA restored cetuximab sensitivity in
		  GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells, whereas exogenous activation of
		  MET by HGF stimulation in cetuximab-sensitive GEO and SW48
		  cells induced resistance to cetuximab. Treatment of GEO-CR
		  and SW48-CR cells with PHA665752, a selective MET
		  inhibitor, inhibited cell growth, proliferation, and
		  survival signals and impaired cancer cell migration.
		  Overexpression of TGF-, a specific EGFR ligand, was
		  involved in the acquisition of cetuximab resistance in
		  GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells. In fact, TGF- overexpression
		  induced the EGFR-MET interaction, with subsequent MET
		  phosphorylation and activation of MET downstream effectors
		  in GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells. Conclusions: These results
		  suggest that overexpression of TGF- through induction of
		  EGFR-MET interaction contributes to cetuximab resistance in
		  colorectal cancer cells. The combined inhibition of EGFR
		  and MET receptor could represent a strategy for preventing
		  and/or overcoming cetuximab resistance in patients with
		  colorectal cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 19(24); 6751-65.

  abstract	= {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers
		  worldwide. More than half of all CRC patients will develop
		  metastases, which represents the major cause of death for
		  CRC patients. CRC metastases confined in other organs are
		  potentially resectable, and patients who receive curative
		  resections appear to have better outcomes. Thus, the early
		  detection of metastasis in CRC patients could improve their
		  survival rate after curative surgery. Here, we report the
		  use of Cy-dye labeling combined with multi-dimensional
		  fractionation and mass spectrometry as a proteomics-based
		  approach for identifying CRC metastasis-associated
		  biomarker(s) in plasma samples collected from three CRC
		  patients upon diagnosis of their primary and metastatic
		  tumors. Among the eight identified proteins, we used
		  Western blot analysis and an in-house-developed ELISA to
		  validate the increased plasma levels of one, secretory
		  (plasma) gelsolin, in {\textgreater}80{\%} of CRC patients
		  with distal metastases in a larger sample cohort (32
		  patients). We also found a significant increase of
		  secretory gelsolin in plasma samples of stage IV versus
		  stages I-III CRC patients before treatment. Furthermore,
		  immunohistochemistry showed that secretory gelsolin was
		  highly overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens compared to
		  adjacent normal tissues, and a cell model study showed that
		  secretory gelsolin may help regulate CRC cell migration.},

		  disease (IHD) in Taiwanese type 2 diabetic patients.
		  Methods. A total of 394 male patients aging ≥45 years and
		  without previous heart disease were studied. Among them 349
		  had no habit of chewing betel nut and 45 possessed the
		  habit for ≥5 years. Subclinical IHD was diagnosed by a
		  Minnesota-coded resting electrocardiogram and was present
		  in 71 cases. Statistical analyses were performed
		  considering confounding effects of age, diabetic duration,
		  smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and
		  metabolic control status. Results. Betel nut chewers were
		  younger and had higher prevalence of smoking (86.7{\%}
		  versus 60.5{\%}), higher body mass index, poorer glycemic
		  control, and higher prevalence of subclinical IHD (28.9{\%}
		  versus 16.6{\%}). Patients with subclinical IHD were older
		  and had higher prevalence of betel nut chewing (18.0{\%}
		  versus 9.9{\%}). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for
		  subclinical IHD for chewers versus nonchewers was 4.640
		  (1.958-10.999). The adjusted odds ratios in younger or
		  older patients divided by the median age of 63 years were
		  similar: 4.724 (1.346-16.581) and 4.666 (1.278-17.028),
		  respectively. Conclusions. Betel nut chewing is
		  significantly associated with increased risk of subclinical

  abstract	= {The Imitation Game I PROPOSE to consider the question,
		  ‘Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions
		  of the meaning of the terms ‘machine' and ‘think'. The
		  definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as
		  possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
		  dangerous. If the meaning of the words ‘machine' and
		  ‘think' are to be found by examining how they are
		  commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that
		  the meaning and the answer to the question, ‘Can machines
		  think?' is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a
		  Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such
		  a definition I shall replace the question by another, which
		  is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively
		  unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be
		  described in terms of a game which we call the ‘imitation
		  game'. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman
		  (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The
		  interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The
		  object of the game for the interrogator is to determine
		  which of the other two is the man and which is the woman.
		  He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game
		  he says either ‘X is A and Y is B' or ‘X is B and Y is
		  A'. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B
		  thus: C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her
		  hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It
		  is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the
		  wrong identification. His answer might therefore be ‘My
		  hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine
		  inches long.' In order that tones of voice may not help the
		  interrogator the answers should be written, or better
		  still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a
		  teleprinter communicating between the two rooms.
		  Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by
		  an intermediary. The object of the game for the third
		  player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy
		  for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add
		  such things as ‘I am the woman, don't listen to him!' to
		  her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make
		  similar remarks. We now ask the question, ‘What will
		  happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?'
		  Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game
		  is played like this as he does when the game is played
		  between a man and a woman? These questions replace our
		  original, ‘Can machines think?' ...},

  abstract	= {Recent initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas have
		  mapped the genome-wide effect of individual genes on tumor
		  growth. By unraveling genomic alterations in tumors,
		  molecular subtypes of cancers have been identified, which
		  is improving patient diagnostics and treatment. Uhlen et
		  al. developed a computer-based modeling approach to examine
		  different cancer types in nearly 8000 patients. They
		  provide an open-access resource for exploring how the
		  expression of specific genes influences patient survival in
		  17 different types of cancer. More than 900,000 patient
		  survival profiles are available, including for tumors of
		  colon, prostate, lung, and breast origin. This interactive
		  data set can also be used to generate personalized patient
		  models to predict how metabolic changes can influence tumor
		  growth.Science, this issue p. eaan2507INTRODUCTIONCancer is
		  a leading cause of death worldwide, and there is great need
		  to define the molecular mechanisms driving the development
		  and progression of individual tumors. The Hallmarks of
		  Cancer has provided a framework for a deeper molecular
		  understanding of cancer, and the focus so far has been on
		  the genetic alterations in individual cancers, including
		  genome rearrangements, gene amplifications, and specific
		  cancer-driving mutations. Using systems-level approaches,
		  it is now also possible to define downstream effects of
		  individual genetic alterations in a genome-wide
		  manner.RATIONALEIn our study, we used a systems-level
		  approach to analyze the transcriptome of 17 major cancer
		  types with respect to clinical outcome, based on a
		  genome-wide transcriptomics analysis of {\~{}}8000
		  individual patients with clinical metadata. The study was
		  made possible through the availability of large open-access
		  knowledge-based efforts such as the Cancer Genome Atlas and
		  the Human Protein Atlas. Here, we used the data to perform
		  a systems-level analysis of 17 major human cancer types,
		  describing both interindividual and intertumor variation
		  patterns.RESULTSThe analysis identified candidate
		  prognostic genes associated with clinical outcome for each
		  tumor type; the results show that a large fraction of
		  cancer protein-coding genes are differentially expressed
		  and, in many cases, have an impact on overall patient
		  survival. Systems biology analyses revealed that gene
		  expression of individual tumors within a particular cancer
		  varied considerably and could exceed the variation observed
		  between distinct cancer types. No general prognostic gene
		  necessary for clinical outcome was applicable to all
		  cancers. Shorter patient survival was generally associated
		  with up-regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell
		  growth and down-regulation of genes involved in cellular
		  differentiation. The data allowed us to generate
		  personalized genome-scale metabolic models for cancer
		  patients to identify key genes involved in tumor growth. In
		  addition, we explored tissue-specific genes associated with
		  the dedifferentiation of tumor cells and the role of
		  specific cancer testis antigens on a genome-wide scale. For
		  lung and colorectal cancer, a selection of prognostic genes
		  identified by the systems biology effort were analyzed in
		  independent, prospective cancer cohorts using
		  immunohistochemistry to validate the gene expression
		  patterns at the protein level. CONCLUSIONA Human Pathology
		  Atlas has been created as part of the Human Protein Atlas
		  program to explore the prognostic role of each
		  protein-coding gene in 17 different cancers. Our atlas uses
		  transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling to provide a
		  standalone resource for cancer precision medicine. The
		  results demonstrate the power of large systems biology
		  efforts that make use of publicly available resources.
		  Using genome-scale metabolic models, cancer patients are
		  shown to have widespread metabolic heterogeneity,
		  highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine
		  for cancer treatment. With more than 900,000 Kaplan-Meier
		  plots, this resource allows exploration of the specific
		  genes influencing clinical outcome for major cancers,
		  paving the way for further in-depth studies incorporating
		  systems-level analyses of cancer. All data presented are

  abstract	= {Proliferating cells, including cancer cells, require
		  altered metabolism to efficiently incorporate nutrients
		  such as glucose into biomass. The M2 isoform of pyruvate
		  kinase (PKM2) promotes the metabolism of glucose by aerobic
		  glycolysis and contributes to anabolic metabolism.
		  Paradoxically, decreased pyruvate kinase enzyme activity
		  accompanies the expression of PKM2 in rapidly dividing
		  cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that
		  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the substrate for pyruvate
		  kinase in cells, can act as a phosphate donor in mammalian
		  cells because PEP participates in the phosphorylation of
		  the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM1) in
		  PKM2-expressing cells. We used mass spectrometry to show
		  that the phosphate from PEP is transferred to the catalytic
		  histidine (His11) on human PGAM1. This reaction occurred at
		  physiological concentrations of PEP and produced pyruvate
		  in the absence of PKM2 activity. The presence of
		  histidine-phosphorylated PGAM1 correlated with the

  abstract	= {Objective: Surgical resection remains the primary
		  treatment for the majority of solid tumors. Despite efforts
		  to obtain wide margins, close or positive surgical margins
		  ({\textless}5 mm) are found in 15–30{\%} of head and neck
		  cancer patients. Obtaining negative margins requires
		  immediate, intraoperative feedback of margin status. To
		  this end, we propose optical specimen mapping of resected
		  tumor specimens immediately after removal. Materials and
		  methods: A first-in-human pilot study was performed in
		  patients (n = 8) after infusion of fluorescently labeled
		  antibody, panitumumab-IRDye800 to allow surgical mapping of
		  the tumor specimen. Patients underwent standard of care
		  surgical resection for head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (HNSCC). Optical specimen mapping was performed
		  on the primary tumor specimen and correlated with
		  pathological findings after tissue processing. Results:
		  Optical mapping of the specimen had a 95{\%} sensitivity
		  and 89{\%} specificity to detect cancer within 5 mm (n =
		  160) of the cut surface. To detect tumor within 2 mm of the
		  specimen surface, the sensitivity of optical specimen
		  mapping was 100{\%}. The maximal observed penetration depth
		  of panitumumab-IRDye800 through human tissue in our study
		  was 6.3 mm. Conclusion: Optical specimen mapping is a
		  highly sensitive and specific method for evaluation of
		  margins within {\textless}5 mm of the tumor mass in HNSCC
		  specimens. This technology has potentially broad
		  applications for ensuring adequate tumor resection and
		  negative margins in head and neck cancers.},

		  skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue, where its
		  expression is postnatal, coincident with the acquisition of
		  insulin-regulated glucose transport. In muscle, contraction
		  also regulates GLUT4 activity in the postnatal animal. Here
		  we demonstrate that GLUT4 is expressed in the developing
		  mouse embryo with specific tissue and spatiotemporal
		  patterns. From embryonic day 9 (E9; E1 = day of copulation
		  plug) to postnatal day 70 (P70), mice were analyzed for
		  GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression by in situ hybridization,
		  immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. Specificity was
		  confirmed with sense riboprobe hybridization and peptide
		  competition, respectively. At E9, GLUT4 was detected in the
		  cranial neural folds in the outer (mantle) layer of the
		  neuroepithelium. At E10, expression was present throughout
		  the developing heart and was prominent in the endocardial
		  cushions through E12. At E10-12, GLUT4 was also prominent
		  in craniofacial mesenchyme. GLUT4 expression in cartilage
		  and bone was evident at E12 and was maintained throughout
		  early postnatal life. GLUT4 was apparent throughout
		  embryonic development in the ventricular epithelium,
		  choroid plexus and in the developing cerebellum. At birth,
		  cardiac expression was reduced and GLUT4 was most evident
		  in cartilage, bone and specific brain regions. In the
		  latter, GLUT4 expression was most evident in the
		  cerebellum, specifically in the external granular layer
		  through P7 and in the internal granular layer thereafter.
		  Maximal GLUT4 protein levels in the cerebellum were

		  and neck. We investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus
		  platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in
		  patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell
		  carcinoma of the head and neck. Methods: We randomly
		  assigned 220 of 442 eligible patients with untreated
		  recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head
		  and neck to receive cisplatin (at a dose of 100 mg per
		  square meter of body-surface area on day 1) or carboplatin
		  (at an area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per
		  minute, as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1) plus
		  fluorouracil (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter per day
		  for 4 days) every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles and 222
		  patients to receive the same chemotherapy plus cetuximab
		  (at a dose of 400 mg per square meter initially, as a
		  2-hour intravenous infusion, then 250 mg per square meter,
		  as a 1-hour intravenous infusion per week) for a maximum of
		  6 cycles. Patients with stable disease who received
		  chemotherapy plus cetuximab continued to receive cetuximab
		  until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects,
		  whichever occurred first. Results: Adding cetuximab to
		  platinum-based chemotherapy with fluorouracil
		  (platinum-fluorouracil) significantly prolonged the median
		  overall survival from 7.4 months in the chemotherapy-alone
		  group to 10.1 months in the group that received
		  chemotherapy plus cetuximab (hazard ratio for death, 0.80;
		  95{\%} confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.99; P = 0.04). The
		  addition of cetuximab prolonged the median progression-free
		  survival time from 3.3 to 5.6 months (hazard ratio for
		  progression, 0.54; P{\textless}0.001) and increased the
		  response rate from 20{\%} to 36{\%} (P{\textless}0.001).
		  The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the
		  chemotherapy-alone and cetuximab groups were anemia (19{\%}
		  and 13{\%}, respectively), neutropenia (23{\%} and 22{\%}),
		  and thrombocytopenia (11{\%} in both groups). Sepsis
		  occurred in 9 patients in the cetuximab group and in 1
		  patient in the chemotherapy-alone group (P = 0.02). Of 219
		  patients receiving cetuximab, 9{\%} had grade 3 skin
		  reactions and 3{\%} had grade 3 or 4 infusion-related
		  reactions. There were no cetuximab-related deaths.
		  Conclusions: As compared with platinum-based chemotherapy
		  plus fluorouracil alone, cetuximab plus
		  platinum-fluorouracil chemotherapy improved overall
		  survival when given as first-line treatment in patients

		  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and
		  immunohistochemistry were used to confirm observed changes

		  Conclusions: Groups of presumed metastasis-related genes

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Tissue MicroArray technology aims to perform
		  immunohistochemical staining on hundreds of different
		  tissue samples simultaneously. It allows faster analysis,
		  considerably reducing costs incurred in staining. A time
		  consuming phase of the methodology is the selection of
		  tissue areas within paraffin blocks: no utilities have been
		  developed for the identification of areas to be punched
		  from the donor block and assembled in the recipient block.
		  
		  RESULTS: The presented work supports, in the specific case
		  of a primary subtype of breast cancer (tubular breast
		  cancer), the semi-automatic discrimination and localization
		  between normal and pathological regions within the tissues.
		  The diagnosis is performed by analysing specific
		  morphological features of the sample such as the absence of
		  a double layer of cells around the lumen and the decay of a
		  regular glands-and-lobules structure. These features are
		  analysed using an algorithm which performs the extraction
		  of morphological parameters from images and compares them
		  to experimentally validated threshold values. Results are
		  satisfactory since in most of the cases the automatic
		  diagnosis matches the response of the pathologists. In
		  particular, on a total of 1296 sub-images showing normal
		  and pathological areas of breast specimens, algorithm
		  accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are respectively
		  89{\%}, 84{\%} and 94{\%}.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: The proposed work is a first attempt to
		  demonstrate that automation in the Tissue MicroArray field
		  is feasible and it can represent an important tool for
		  scientists to cope with this high-throughput technique.},

		  However, it is becoming increasingly clear that tumors are

		  determine the effect of radiation on the metabolic state of
		  these two cell populations. Luminal, basal, and claudin-low
		  breast cancer cell lines were propagated as mammospheres
		  enriched in BCSCs. Lactate production, glucose consumption,
		  and ATP content were compared with differentiated cultures.
		  A metabolic flux analyzer was used to determine the oxygen
		  consumption, extracellular acidification rates, maximal
		  mitochondria capacity, and mitochondrial proton leak. The
		  effect of radiation treatment of the metabolic phenotype of
		  each cell population was also determined. BCSCs consume
		  more glucose, produce less lactate, and have higher ATP
		  content compared to their differentiated progeny. BCSCs
		  have higher maximum mitochondrial capacity and
		  mitochondrial proton leak compared to their differentiated
		  progeny. Radiation treatment enhances the higher energetic
		  state of the BCSCs, while decreasing mitochondrial proton
		  leak. Our study indicated that breast cancer cells are
		  heterogeneous in their metabolic phenotypes and BCSCs
		  reside in a distinct metabolic state compared to their
		  differentiated progeny. BCSCs display a reliance on
		  oxidative phosphorylation, while the more differentiated
		  progeny displays a more glycolytic phenotype. Radiation
		  treatment affects the metabolic state of BCSCs. We conclude

		  GLUT1 is expressed at high levels in tissue barriers such
		  as the blood-brain barrier, and this isoform has been
		  suggested as an indicator of such barriers. GLUT1 has been
		  found in basal layers of human epidermis where no such
		  tissue barrier is present. To further clarify these issues,
		  we examined the distribution of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in skin,
		  different types of oral mucosa from rat and man, and a

		  expressed in ductal- and myoepithelial cells of minor

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
		  tomography (FDG-PET) images are usually quantitatively
		  analyzed in "whole-tumor" volumes of interest. Also
		  parameters determined with dynamic PET acquisitions, such
		  as the Patlak glucose metabolic rate (MR(glc)) and
		  pharmacokinetic rate constants of two-tissue compartment
		  modeling, are most often derived per lesion. We propose
		  segmentation of tumors to determine tumor heterogeneity,
		  potentially useful for dose-painting in radiotherapy and
		  elucidating mechanisms of FDG uptake.
		  
		  METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 41 patients with 104 lesions,
		  dynamic FDG-PET was performed. On MR(glc) images, tumors
		  were segmented in quartiles of background subtracted
		  maximum MR(glc) (0{\%}-25{\%}, 25{\%}-50{\%},
		  50{\%}-75{\%}, and 75{\%}-100{\%}). Pharmacokinetic
		  analysis was performed using an irreversible two-tissue
		  compartment model in the three segments with highest
		  MR(glc) to determine the rate constants of FDG metabolism.
		  
		  RESULTS: From the highest to the lowest quartile,
		  significant decreases of uptake (K(1)), washout (k(2)), and
		  phosphorylation (k(3)) rate constants were seen with
		  significant increases in tissue blood volume fraction
		  (V(b)).
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: Tumor regions with highest MR(glc) are
		  characterized by high cellular uptake and phosphorylation
		  rate constants with relatively low blood volume fractions.
		  In regions with less metabolic activity, the blood volume
		  fraction increases and cellular uptake, washout, and
		  phosphorylation rate constants decrease. These results
		  support the hypothesis that regional tumor glucose
		  phosphorylation rate is not dependent on the transport of
		  nutrients (i.e., FDG) to the tumor.},

  abstract	= {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a major
		  cause of morbidity and mortality underscoring the need for
		  safe and effective chemopreventive strategies. Targeting
		  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is attractive in
		  that it is an early critical event in HNSCC pathogenesis.
		  However, current agents lack efficacy or have unacceptable
		  toxicity. Several groups have demonstrated that the
		  over-the-counter medication, polyethylene glycol (PEG) has
		  remarkable chemopreventive efficacy against colon
		  carcinogenesis. Importantly, we reported that this effect
		  is mediated through EGFR internalization/degradation. In
		  the current study, we investigated the chemopreventive
		  efficacy of this agent against HNSCC, using both the well
		  validated animal model 4-NQO (4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide) rat
		  model and cell culture with the human HNSCC cell line
		  SCC-25. We demonstrated that daily topical application of
		  10{\%} PEG-8000 in the oral cavity (tongue and cavity wall)
		  post 4NQO initiation resulted in a significant reduction in
		  tumor burden (both, tumor size and tumors/tumor bearing
		  rat) without any evidence of toxicity. Immunohistochemical
		  studies depicted decreased proliferation (number of
		  Ki67-positive cells) and reduced expression of EGFR and its
		  downstream effectors cyclin D1 in the tongue mucosa of
		  4NQO-rats treated with PEG. We showed that EGFR was also
		  markedly downregulated in SCC-25 cells by PEG-8000 with a
		  concomitant induction of G1-S phase cell-cycle arrest,
		  which was potentially mediated through upregulated
		  p21(cip1/waf1). In conclusion, we demonstrate, for the
		  first time, that PEG has promising efficacy and safety as a
		  chemopreventive efficacy against oral carcinogenesis.},

  abstract	= {UNLABELLED:
		  
		  BACKGROUND: Over 90{\%} of adults aged 20 years or older
		  with permanent teeth have suffered from dental caries
		  leading to pain, infection, or even tooth loss. Although
		  caries prevalence has decreased over the past decade, there
		  are still about 23{\%} of dentate adults who have untreated
		  carious lesions in the US. Dental caries is a complex
		  disorder affected by both individual susceptibility and
		  environmental factors. Approximately 35-55{\%} of caries
		  phenotypic variation in the permanent dentition is
		  attributable to genes, though few specific caries genes
		  have been identified. Therefore, we conducted the first
		  genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genes
		  affecting susceptibility to caries in adults.
		  
		  METHODS: Five independent cohorts were included in this
		  study, totaling more than 7000 participants. For each
		  participant, dental caries was assessed and genetic markers
		  (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) were genotyped or
		  imputed across the entire genome. Due to the heterogeneity
		  among the five cohorts regarding age, genotyping platform,
		  quality of dental caries assessment, and study design, we
		  first conducted genome-wide association (GWA) analyses on
		  each of the five independent cohorts separately. We then
		  performed three meta-analyses to combine results for: (i)
		  the comparatively younger, Appalachian cohorts
		  (N = 1483) with well-assessed caries phenotype, (ii)
		  the comparatively older, non-Appalachian cohorts
		  (N = 5960) with inferior caries phenotypes, and (iii)
		  all five cohorts (N = 7443). Top ranking genetic loci
		  within and across meta-analyses were scrutinized for
		  biologically plausible roles on caries.
		  
		  RESULTS: Different sets of genes were nominated across the
		  three meta-analyses, especially between the younger and
		  older age cohorts. In general, we identified several
		  suggestive loci (P-value ≤ 10E-05) within or near
		  genes with plausible biological roles for dental caries,
		  including RPS6KA2 and PTK2B, involved in p38-depenedent

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Desmocollin3 (DSC3) is a member of the
		  cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell adhesion
		  molecules and plays an important role in tumor invasion and
		  metastasis. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic
		  mechanism that regulates DSC3 expression in esophageal
		  adenocarcinomas (EACs).
		  
		  METHODS: Expression of DSC3 was analyzed by quantitative
		  real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The promoter
		  DNA methylation level of DSC3 was examined using
		  quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing.
		  
		  RESULTS: The qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated significant
		  down-regulation of the DSC3 mRNA levels in human EAC cell
		  lines and tissue samples (P{\textless}.001). In addition,
		  the EAC cell lines and tumor samples have aberrant promoter
		  hypermethylation as compared to normal esophageal samples
		  (P{\textless}.001). DSC3 promoter hypermethylation
		  ({\textgreater}10{\%} methylation level) was detected in
		  97.5{\%} (39/40) of EAC samples whereas none of the normal
		  tissue samples showed hypermethylation (P{\textless}.0001).
		  There was a significant inverse correlation between
		  promoter DNA methylation levels and mRNA expression folds
		  for DSC3 (coefficient r=-0.685, P{\textless}.0001).
		  Treatment of FLO-1 and SKGT4 EAC cells with
		  5-Aza-deoxytidine led to a significant reduction in the
		  promoter DNA methylation levels with restoration of the
		  DSC3 expression, suggesting that promoter DNA methylation
		  is a key epigenetic mechanism regulating DSC3 expression.
		  High DSC3 promoter DNA methylation levels were
		  significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage
		  (P{\textless}.001) and lymph node metastasis
		  (P{\textless}.001).
		  
		  CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that
		  epigenetic silencing of DSC3 is a frequent finding in EAC
		  that is possibly associated with advanced stages.},

		  cancers is lacking. Our study explored the associations of

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cancer, as the most challenging
		  part in the human disease history, has always been one of
		  the main threats to human life and health. The high
		  mortality of cancer is largely due to the complexity of
		  cancer and the significant differences in clinical
		  outcomes. Therefore, it will be significant to improve
		  accuracy of cancer survival prediction, which has become
		  one of the main fields of cancer research. Many calculation
		  models for cancer survival prediction have been proposed at
		  present, but most of them generate prediction models only
		  by using single genomic data or clinical data. Multiple
		  genomic data and clinical data have not been integrated yet
		  to take a comprehensive consideration of cancers and
		  predict their survival. METHOD: In order to effectively
		  integrate multiple genomic data (including genetic
		  expression, copy number alteration, DNA methylation and
		  exon expression) and clinical data and apply them to
		  predictive studies on cancer survival, similar network
		  fusion algorithm (SNF) was proposed in this paper to
		  integrate multiple genomic data and clinical data so as to
		  generate sample similarity matrix, min-redundancy and
		  max-relevance algorithm (mRMR) was used to conduct feature
		  selection of multiple genomic data and clinical data of
		  cancer samples and generate sample feature matrix, and
		  finally two matrixes were used for semi-supervised training
		  through graph convolutional network (GCN) so as to obtain a
		  cancer survival prediction method integrating multiple
		  genomic data and clinical data based on graph convolutional
		  network (GCGCN). RESULT: Performance indexes of GCGCN model
		  indicate that both multiple genomic data and clinical data
		  play significant roles in the accurate survival time
		  prediction of cancer patients. It is compared with existing
		  survival prediction methods, and results show that cancer
		  survival prediction method GCGCN which integrates multiple
		  genomic data and clinical data has obviously superior
		  prediction effect than existing survival prediction
		  methods. CONCLUSION: All study results in this paper have
		  verified effectiveness and superiority of GCGCN in the
		  aspect of cancer survival prediction.},

  abstract	= {Altered metabolism in tumor cells is increasingly
		  recognized as a core component of the neoplastic phenotype.
		  Because p53 has emerged as a master metabolic regulator, we
		  hypothesized that the presence of wild-type p53 in
		  glioblastoma cells could confer a selective advantage to
		  these cells under the adverse conditions of the glioma
		  microenvironment. Here, we report on the effects of the
		  p53-dependent effector Tp53-induced glycolysis and
		  apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) on hypoxia-induced cell death.
		  We demonstrate that TIGAR is overexpressed in glioblastomas
		  and that ectopic expression of TIGAR reduces cell death
		  induced by glucose and oxygen restriction. Metabolic
		  analyses revealed that TIGAR inhibits glycolysis and
		  promotes respiration. Further, generation of reactive
		  oxygen species (ROS) levels was reduced whereas levels of
		  reduced glutathione were elevated in TIGAR-expressing
		  cells. Finally, inhibiting the transketolase isoenzyme
		  transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) by siRNA reversed theses
		  effects of TIGAR. These findings suggest that glioma cells
		  benefit from TIGAR expression by (i) improving energy yield
		  from glucose via increased respiration and (ii) enhancing

  abstract	= {Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer account for more than
		  7000 deaths annually, with an annual incidence of more than
		  30,000 new cases within the United States.1 Worldwide it is
		  the sixth most common malignancy, with incidence varying
		  greatly among di erent geographic locations. Its prevalence
		  can range from countries with rates similar to those in the
		  United States, to countries such as India, where death from
		  oral cavity cancer is one of the top three forms of cancer
		  death. Even within the U.S. population, a vefold di erence
		  in mor- tality is seen among states, likely a result of di
		  erences in eth- nic and socioeconomic factors as well as
		  the use of tobacco products.2 Despite improvements in
		  treatment, long-term survival rates are relatively
		  unchanged over the past 30 years. For the oral and
		  maxillofacial surgeon, an understanding of this disease and
		  its impact on society, as well as the surgeon's role in
		  identi cation and treatment, is imperative.},

		  Lymph node basins that drain the oral cavity are divided
		  into five groups based on anatomically defined
		  structures.  •  Level I—includes the submental nodes
		  bounded by the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles
		  and the hyoid bone as well as the submandibular group
		  bounded by the body of the mandible and the posterior
		  bellies of the digastric muscles bilaterally.  •  Level
		  II—includes the upper jugular lymph nodes extending from
		  the base of the skull to the level of the carotid artery
		  bifurcation. The anterior border is the lateral aspect of
		  the sternohyoid muscle, with the posterior border of the
		  sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle serving as the posterior
		  border of the level. Level II is also subdivided into
		  levels IIA (inferior medial) and IIB (superior lateral) by
		  the spinal accessory nerve.  •  Level III—includes
		  nodes located adjacent to the middle third of the internal
		  jugular vein from the carotid bifurcation to the omohyoid
		  muscle, with the same anterior and posterior boundaries as
		  level II.  •  Level IV—includes the lower jugular
		  group, inferior to the omohyoid and superior to the
		  clavicle, with the same anterior and posterior boundaries
		  as levels II and III.  •  Level V—includes nodes
		  anterior to the anterior border of the trapezius and
		  posterior to the posterior border of the SCM. The inferior
		  border of this level is the clavicle.},

		  Therefore, the spatial distribution of proteins that

		  IHC is a technique that allows a resolution down to the
		  subcellular level. However, the detection and measurement
		  of a specific protein expression level is possible only by
		  semiquantitative methods. Moreover, prior knowledge about
		  the identity of the proteins of interest is necessary. In

		  that belongs to the Dickkopf family. The protein can
		  inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway which plays a key role in
		  the carcinogenesis and progression of various types of
		  cancers. Based on this, we hypothesized that the
		  differential expression of DKK1 may figure significantly in
		  cancers by regulating Wnt signaling pathway transduction.
		  In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis to
		  evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic value of DKK1
		  expression level in human cancers. METHODS: The expression
		  level was analyzed by using the Oncomine database and Gene
		  Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tool. The
		  analysis of prognosis was conducted by using the UALCAN,
		  Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and
		  DriverDBv3 databases. We also investigated using DKK1
		  promoter methylation to define cancer types through the
		  UALCAN database. Meanwhile, the related functional networks
		  of DKK1 were analyzed by using the GeneMANIA interactive
		  tool and Cytoscape software. Furthermore, Gene Ontology and
		  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis
		  was conducted using the Metascape online website, and we
		  used the cBioPotartal database to explored DKK1 expression,
		  aberrant information, and the co-expression genes in the
		  subgroups of lung cancer. Finally, we performed the overall
		  survival (OS) meta-analysis of the DKK1 expression in lung
		  squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) via the Lung Cancer Explorer
		  (LCE). RESULTS: DKK1 was differentially expressed in
		  different types of human cancers. DKK1 was overexpressed in
		  human cancers including head and neck squamous cell
		  carcinoma (HNSC), LUSC, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
		  (PAAD). Overexpression of DKK1 indicated adverse OS in
		  bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), HNSC, and PADD, but no
		  difference in OS was found between the LUSC and healthy
		  groups. The high expression of DKK1 was also associated
		  with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in HNSC, LUSC, and
		  PAAD. Gene regulation network analysis indicated that DKK1
		  was mainly involved in Wnt signaling pathways and several
		  other signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed
		  that DKK1 is significantly expressed in various cancers and
		  could be a biomarker for targeted therapy and a predictor
		  for prognosis of these specific cancers. The bioinformatics
		  analysis revealed a significant overexpression of DKK1 in
		  HNSC, LUSC, and PAAD, with DKK1 overexpression being
		  associated with adverse outcome in these patients, but how
		  DKK1 expression levels relate to hematological malignancies
		  and prognosis is still unclear. These new insights into the
		  function of DKK1 may provide a basis for new targeted drug
		  therapy and an avenue for further investigation into the
		  mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis of DKK1 in different
		  cancer types.},

		  Switzerland (outside the USA). Purpose: An examination of
		  multiple primary cancers can provide insight into the
		  etiologic role of genes, the environment, and prior cancer
		  treatment on a cancer patient's risk of developing a
		  subsequent cancer. Different rules for registering multiple
		  primary cancers (MP) are used by cancer registries
		  throughout the world making data comparisons difficult.
		  Methods: We evaluated the effect of SEER and IARC/IACR
		  rules on cancer incidence rates and trends using data from
		  the SEER Program. We estimated age-standardized incidence
		  rate (ASIR) and trends (1975–2011) for the top 26 cancer
		  categories using joinpoint regression analysis. Results:
		  ASIRs were higher using SEER compared to IARC/IACR rules
		  for all cancers combined (3 {\%}) and, in rank order,
		  melanoma (9 {\%}), female breast (7 {\%}), urinary bladder
		  (6 {\%}), colon (4 {\%}), kidney and renal pelvis (4 {\%}),
		  oral cavity and pharynx (3 {\%}), lung and bronchus (2
		  {\%}), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2 {\%}). ASIR differences
		  were largest for patients aged 65+ years. Trends were
		  similar using both MP rules with the exception of cancers
		  of the urinary bladder, and kidney and renal pelvis.
		  Conclusions: The choice of multiple primary coding rules
		  effects incidence rates and trends. Compared to SEER MP
		  coding rules, IARC/IACR rules are less complex, have not
		  changed over time, and report fewer multiple primary
		  cancers, particularly cancers that occur in paired organs,
		  at the same anatomic site and with the same or related
		  histologic type. Cancer registries collecting incidence
		  data using SEER rules may want to consider including
		  incidence rates and trends using IARC/IACR rules to
		  facilitate international data comparisons.},

		  lymph node metastasis, independent of HPV16 status and that
		  disruptive TP53 mutations are associated with lymph node
		  metastasis in HPV16 DNA- tumors. We validate each of these

		  interventions in the quest to eliminate
		  healthcare-associated infections, and rates in healthcare
		  facilities are markedly low. Since hand hygiene observation
		  and feedback are critical to improve adherence, we created
		  an easy-to-use, platform-independent hand hygiene data
		  collection process and an automated, on-demand reporting
		  engine. METHODS: A 3-step approach was used for this
		  project: 1) creation of a data collection form using Google
		  Forms, 2) transfer of data from the form to a spreadsheet
		  using Google Spreadsheets, and 3) creation of an automated,
		  cloud-based analytics platform for report generation using
		  R and RStudio Shiny software. RESULTS: A video tutorial of
		  all steps in the creation and use of this free tool can be
		  found on our YouTube channel:
		  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFatMR1rXqU{\&}t. The
		  on-demand reporting tool can be accessed at:
		  https://crsp.louisville.edu/shiny/handhygiene. CONCLUSIONS:
		  This data collection and automated analytics engine
		  provides an easy-to-use environment for evaluating hand
		  hygiene data; it also provides rapid feedback to healthcare
		  workers. By reducing some of the data management workload

  abstract	= {Co-expression modules are groups of genes with highly
		  correlated expression patterns. In cancer, differences in
		  module activity potentially represent the heterogeneity of
		  phenotypes important in carcinogenesis, progression, or
		  treatment response. To find gene expression modules active
		  in breast cancer subpopulations, we assembled 72 breast
		  cancer-related gene expression datasets containing ∼5,700
		  samples altogether. Per dataset, we identified genes with
		  bimodal expression and used mixture model clustering to
		  ultimately define 11 modules of genes that are consistently
		  co-regulated across multiple datasets. Functionally, these
		  modules reflected estrogen signaling, development/
		  differentiation, immune signaling, histone modification,
		  ERBB2 signaling, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and stroma,
		  and cell proliferation. The Tcell/Bcell immune modules
		  appeared tumor-extrinsic, with coherent expression in
		  tumors but not cell lines; whereas most other modules,
		  interferon and ECM included, appeared intrinsic. Only four
		  of the eleven modules were represented in the PAM50
		  intrinsic subtype classifier and other well-established
		  prognostic signatures; although the immune modules were
		  highly correlated to previously published immune
		  signatures. As expected, the proliferation module was
		  highly associated with decreased recurrence-free survival
		  (RFS). Interestingly, the immune modules appeared
		  associated with RFS even after adjustment for receptor
		  subtype and proliferation; and in a multivariate analysis,
		  the combination of Tcell/Bcell immune module
		  down-regulation and proliferation module upregulation
		  strongly associated with decreased RFS. Immune modules are
		  unusual in that their upregulation is associated with a
		  good prognosis without chemotherapy and a good response to
		  chemotherapy, suggesting the paradox of high immune
		  patients who respond to chemotherapy but would do well
		  without it. Other findings concern the ECM/stromal modules,
		  which despite common themes were associated with different
		  sites of metastasis, possibly relating to the "seed and
		  soil" hypothesis of cancer dissemination. Overall,
		  co-expression modules provide a high-level functional view
		  of breast cancer that complements the "cancer hallmarks"
		  and may form the basis for improved predictors and

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
		  is a highly lethal cancer that contains cellular and
		  functional heterogeneity. Previously, we enriched a
		  subpopulation of highly tumorigenic head and neck cancer
		  initiating cells (HN-CICs) from HNSCC. However, the
		  molecular mechanisms by which to govern the characteristics
		  of HN-CICs remain unclear. GRP78, a stress-inducible
		  endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, has been reported to play
		  a crucial role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells,
		  but the role of GRP78 in CICs has not been elucidated.
		  
		  RESULTS: Initially, we recognized GRP78 as a putative
		  candidate on mediating the stemness and tumorigenic
		  properties of HN-CICs by differential systemic analyses.
		  Subsequently, cells with GRP78 anchored at the plasma
		  membrane (memGRP78+) exerted cancer stemness properties of
		  self-renewal, differentiation and radioresistance. Of note,
		  xenotransplantation assay indicated merely 100 memGRP78+
		  HNSCCs resulted in tumor growth. Moreover, knockdown of
		  GRP78 significantly reduced the self-renewal ability, side
		  population cells and expression of stemness genes, but
		  inversely promoted cell differentiation and apoptosis in
		  HN-CICs. Targeting GRP78 also lessened tumorigenicity of
		  HN-CICs both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically,
		  co-expression of GRP78 and Nanog predicted the worse
		  survival prognosis of HNSCC patients by immunohistochemical
		  analyses. Finally, depletion of GRP78 in HN-CICs induced
		  the expression of Bax, Caspase 3, and PTEN.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: In summary, memGRP78 should be a novel surface
		  marker for isolation of HN-CICs, and targeting GRP78
		  signaling might be a potential therapeutic strategy for
		  HNSCC through eliminating HN-CICs.},

		  parasites inside the cell. When examined individually, each
		  factor tends to hinder the passage of the iRBC and lengthen
		  the transit time. Moreover, at sufficient magnitude, each
		  may lead to obstruction of narrow microfluidic channels. We
		  then integrate the three factors into a series of
		  simulations that mimic the development of malaria infection
		  through the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages. These
		  simulations successfully reproduce the experimental
		  observation that with progression of infection, the iRBC

		  developed a deep learning system (DLS) to predict disease

		  of the combined cohort including all 10 cancers, the DLS
		  was significantly associated with disease specific survival
		  (hazard ratio of 1.58, 95{\%} CI 1.28–1.70,
		  p{\textless}0.0001) after adjusting for cancer type, stage,
		  age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS

  abstract	= {Timely, and sometimes rapid, metabolic adaptation to
		  changes in food supply is critical for survival as an
		  organism moves from the fasted to the fed state, and vice
		  versa. These transitions necessitate major metabolic
		  changes to maintain energy homeostasis as the source of
		  blood glucose moves away from ingested carbohydrates,
		  through hepatic glycogen stores, towards gluconeogenesis.
		  The integration of hepatic glycogen regulation with
		  extra-hepatic energetics is a key aspect of these adaptive
		  mechanisms. Here we use computational modeling to explore
		  hepatic glycogen regulation under fed and fasting
		  conditions in the context of a whole-body model. The model
		  was validated against previous experimental results
		  concerning glycogen phosphorylase a (active) and glycogen
		  synthase a dynamics. The model qualitatively reproduced
		  physiological changes that occur during transition from the
		  fed to the fasted state. Analysis of the model reveals a
		  critical role for the inhibition of glycogen synthase
		  phosphatase by glycogen phosphorylase a. This negative
		  regulation leads to high levels of glycogen synthase
		  activity during fasting conditions, which in turn increases
		  substrate (futile) cycling, priming the system for a rapid
		  response once an external source of glucose is restored.
		  This work demonstrates that a mechanistic understanding of
		  the design principles used by metabolic control circuits to
		  maintain homeostasis can benefit from the incorporation of
		  mathematical descriptions of these networks into

		  after chronic $\beta$2-adrenoceptor activation.
		  EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Mice with transgenic
		  $\beta$2-adrenoceptor overexpression ($\beta$2-TG) and
		  non-transgenic littermates were either untreated or treated
		  with an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) or NADPH
		  oxidase inhibitors (apocynin, diphenyliodonium). Levels of
		  ROS, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
		  (MAPK), pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen content in
		  the left ventricle (LV) and LV function were measured and
		  compared. KEY RESULTS $\beta$2-TG mice showed increased ROS
		  production, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and heat shock
		  protein 27 (HSP27), expression of pro-inflammatory
		  cytokines and collagen, and progressive ventricular
		  dysfunction. $\beta$2-adrenoceptor stimulation similarly
		  increased ROS production and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK
		  and HSP27 in cultured cardiomyocytes. Treatment with
		  apocynin, diphenyliodonium or NAC reduced phosphorylation
		  of p38 MAPK and HSP27 in both cultured cardiomyocytes and
		  the LV of $\beta$2-TG mice. NAC treatment (500
		  mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}day−1)
		  for 2 weeks eliminated the up-regulated expression of
		  pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen in the LV of
		  $\beta$2-TG mice. Chronic NAC treatment to $\beta$2-TG mice
		  from 7 to 10 months of age largely prevented progression of

		  required for early detection of ESCC. This study was
		  designed to elucidate whether autoantibodies against STIP1
		  could be a diagnostic biomarker in ESCC. An enzyme-linked
		  immunosorbent assay was performed to detect serum levels of
		  STIP1 autoantibodies in a training cohort (148 ESCC
		  patients and 111 controls) and a validation cohort (60 ESCC
		  patients and 40 controls). Mann-Whitney's U test showed
		  that ESCC patients in two cohorts have higher levels of
		  autoantibodies against STIP1 when compared to controls
		  (P{\textless}0.001). According to receiver operating
		  characteristic analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and
		  area under the curve (AUC) of autoantibodies against STIP1
		  in ESCC were 41.9{\%}, 90.1{\%}, and 0.682 in the training
		  cohort and 40.0{\%}, 92.5{\%}, and 0.710 in the validation

		  Stimulation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway is mediated by

		  Five novel genes, LUM, PDE3B, PDGF-C, NRG1 and PKD2, showed

		  oncology in 2017. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Merck's
		  anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody
		  (mAb), received accelerated approval in May 2017 by the US
		  Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and
		  pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid
		  tumors that have been identified as having microsatellite
		  instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair
		  (dMMR). Shortly after, nivolumab (Opdivo), Bristol-Myers
		  Squibb's anti-PD-1 mAb, gained an accelerated approval in
		  August 2017 for adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or
		  dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after
		  standard chemotherapy. These regulatory approvals marked an
		  important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved
		  based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic
		  location in the body where the tumor originated, and
		  therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic
		  therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology
		  annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's
		  oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin
		  receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy
		  on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with
		  neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion
		  proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the
		  anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some
		  basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare
		  patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical
		  efficacy, e.g., near 40{\%} overall response rate (ORR) for
		  pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and
		  75{\%} ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor
		  types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses
		  lasting at least 6 months with complete responses observed;
		  and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric
		  populations. With increasing accessibility to genetic
		  analysis tools such as next-generation sequencing, tumor
		  type-agnostic therapy has become a reality, both during
		  clinical development and in clinical practice. Adjustments
		  in our approaches to developing new anti-cancer drugs and
		  to adopting these new cancer treatments in clinical
		  practice need to occur in order to prepare ourselves for
		  the new era of precision medicine.},

		  was tested on a diverse data set of 100 protein-ligand
		  complexes from the Protein Data Bank. In 79{\%} of these
		  complexes, the docked lowest energy ligand structures had
		  root-mean-square derivations (RMSDs) below 2.0 {\AA} with
		  respect to the corresponding crystal structures. The
		  success rate increased to 85{\%} if the structure water
		  molecules were retained. We evaluated GEMDOCK on two
		  cross-docking experiments in which each ligand of a protein
		  ensemble was docked into each protein of the ensemble.
		  Seventy-six percent of the docked structures had RMSDs
		  below 2.0 A when the ligands were docked into foreign
		  structures. We analyzed and validated GEMDOCK with respect
		  to various search spaces and scoring functions, and found
		  that if the scoring function was perfect, then the
		  predicted accuracy was also essentially perfect. This study
		  suggests that GEMDOCK is a useful tool for molecular
		  recognition and may be used to systematically evaluate and
		  thus improve scoring functions. {\textcopyright} 2004

  abstract	= {The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical
		  role in cell proliferation and oncogenesis. It has been
		  found to be chronically activated in a variety of human
		  cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC). Previously, we have found that the activation of
		  the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibits
		  mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In this study, we extended
		  our studies to determine whether the Wnt/beta-catenin
		  signaling pathway inhibited death receptor-mediated
		  apoptosis in HNSCC cells. We found that Wnt/beta-catenin
		  inhibited not only tumor necrosis factor
		  (TNF)/c-Myc-mediated apoptosis, but also cell
		  detachment-mediated apoptosis (anoikis) which is dependent
		  on the death receptor signaling pathway. Interestingly, we
		  also observed that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway
		  induced HNSCC cell scattering and promoted cell invasion in
		  the Matrigel, both of which are hallmarks for the invasive
		  growth of HNSCC. Consistently, the over-expression of
		  beta-catenin promoted HNSCC tumor growth in nude mice.
		  Taken together, our results suggest that the
		  Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays dual functions in
		  HNSCC development: promoting both cell survival and
		  invasive growth of HNSCC cells.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate
		  in-vivo visible imaging of oral squamous cell carcinoma
		  (OSCC) by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
		  with near-infrared quantum dots.
		  
		  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantum dots with an emission
		  wavelength of 800 nm (QD800) were conjugated to monoclonal
		  antibodies against EGFR, resulting in the probe designated
		  as QD800-EGFR Ab. OSCC cell line (BcaCD885) expressing high
		  levels of EGFR was transplanted subcutaneously into nude
		  mice cheeks to develop an OSCC animal model. QD800-EGFR Ab
		  containing 100 pmol equivalent of QD800 was intravenously
		  injected into the animal model, and in-situ and in-vivo
		  imaging of cheek squamous cell carcinoma was analyzed at 10
		  different time points.
		  
		  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In-vivo imaging and
		  immunohistochemical examination of the tumors showed that
		  intravenously injected QD800-EGFR Ab probe could bind EGFR
		  expressed on BcaCD885 cells. Fluorescence signals of
		  BcaCD885 cells labeled with QD800-EGFR Ab probe could be
		  clearly detected, and these fluorescence signals lasted for
		  24 hours. The most complete tumor images with maximal
		  signal-to-noise ratio were observed from 15 minutes to 6
		  hours after injection of the probe. To the best of the
		  authors' knowledge, this is the first study that has
		  obtained clear in-situ and in-vivo imaging of head and neck
		  cancer by using QD800-EGFR Ab probe. The authors conclude
		  that the combination of near-infrared quantum dots that are
		  highly penetrating for tissues with EGFR monoclonal
		  antibody has promising prospects in in-vivo imaging of OSCC
		  and development of personalized surgical therapies.},

		  association of TNFA genetic variants
		  (−308G{\textgreater}A and −238G{\textgreater}A) with
		  the risk and prognosis of BQ-related oral and pharyngeal
		  squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Design A total of 403
		  subjects (205 cancer cases and 198 healthy controls) who
		  habitually chewed BQ were recruited. The genotypes were
		  determined by TaqMan real-time assays. Results G allele and
		  G/G genotype at TNFA −308 were associated with a
		  1.95-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.16–3.28, pcorrected = 0.024) and
		  2.28-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.30–4.00, pcorrected = 0.008)
		  increased risk of cancer as compared to those with A allele
		  or A/A + A/G genotypes, respectively. In addition, G allele
		  (p = 0.080) and G/G genotype (p = 0.076) at TNFA −238
		  were associated with a borderline but statistically
		  significant increased risk of OPSCC. The combined G/G + G/G
		  genotype at both loci had a 2.37-fold increased risk of
		  OPSCC as compared to those with other combined genotypes
		  (95{\%}CI: 1.41–4.00, p = 0.001). Interactions between
		  combined genotypes and smoking status were also found to
		  contribute to risk of BQ-related OPSCC. There was no
		  association of TNFA genotypes with clinicopathologic
		  findings or the survival of OPSCC patients. Conclusions
		  BQ-chewers who carry the G allele or G/G genotype in TNFA
		  −308 may have an increased risk of OPSCC. The intensity
		  of cigarette smoking modulates the effect of the combined
		  TNFA genotypes on risk of BQ-related OPSCC. Keywords Oral

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: We aim to develop effective models for
		  predicting postoperative distant metastasis for oesophageal
		  squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) for the purpose of guiding
		  tailored therapy.
		  
		  METHODS: We used data from two centres to establish
		  training (n=319) and validation (n=164) cohorts. All
		  patients underwent curative surgical treatment. The
		  clinicopathological features and 23 immunomarkers detected
		  by immunohistochemistry were involved for variable
		  selection. We constructed eight support vector machine
		  (SVM)-based nomograms (SVM1-SVM4 and SVM1'-SVM4'). The
		  nomogram constructed with the training cohort was tested
		  further with the validation cohort.
		  
		  RESULTS: The outcome of the SVM1 model in predicting
		  postoperative distant metastasis was as follows:
		  sensitivity, 44.7{\%}; specificity, 90.9{\%}; positive
		  predictive value, 81.0{\%}; negative predictive value,
		  65.6{\%}; and overall accuracy, 69.5{\%}. The corresponding
		  outcome of the SVM2 model was as follows: 44.7{\%},
		  92.1{\%}, 82.9{\%}, 65.9{\%}, and 70.1{\%}, respectively.
		  The corresponding outcome of the SVM3 model was as follows:
		  55.3{\%}, 93.2{\%}, 87.5{\%}, 70.7{\%}, and 75.6{\%},
		  respectively. The SVM4 model was the most effective
		  nomogram in prediction, and the corresponding outcome was
		  as follows: 56.6{\%}, 97.7{\%}, 95.6{\%}, 72.3{\%}, and
		  78.7{\%}, respectively.Similar results were observed in
		  SVM1', SVM2', SVM3', and SVM4', respectively.
		  
		  CONCLUSION: The SVM-based models integrating
		  clinicopathological features and molecular markers as
		  variables are helpful in selecting the patients of OSCC
		  with high risk of postoperative distant metastasis.},

		  Here, we introduce redox probe 1 and demonstrate its high
		  selectivity in living cells for human hydroxysteroid
		  dehydrogenases (HSDs) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR)
		  superfamily. AKR1C isoforms perform multiple functions
		  among which the metabolism of potent steroid hormones is
		  well documented. Moreover, expression of these enzymes is
		  responsive to cellular stress and pathogenesis, including
		  cancer. Our probe design is based on redox-sensitive
		  optical switches, which couple a ketone-alcohol redox event
		  to a profound change in fluorescence. The high selectivity
		  of phenyl ketone 1 for AKR1C2 over the many endogenous
		  reductases present in mammalian cells was established by a
		  quantitative comparison of the metabolic rates between null
		  control cells (COS-1) and AKR1C2-transfected cells. Phenyl
		  ketone 1 is a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe that permits
		  a direct, real-time, and operationally simple readout of

		  Furthermore, it was demonstrated that probe 1 enables the

		  endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks for predicting survival and
		  evaluating prognosis in cancer patients. However, the
		  pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
		  (HNSCC) remains unclear, and prognostic biomarkers for
		  HNSCC are still lacking. Methods. A total of 546 RNA
		  sequencing profiles of HNSCC patients with clinical outcome
		  data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
		  database, providing a large sample of RNA sequencing data.
		  From these, 71 Long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs, 8 microRNAs
		  (miRNAs), and 16 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified to
		  construct a HNSCC-specific ceRNA network (fold change
		  {\textgreater}2, P {\textless} 0.05). Univariate and
		  multivariate Cox proportional regression models were used
		  to assess independent indicators of prognosis. Then the
		  expression of lncRNAs harboring prognostic value was
		  validated in human HNSCC cell lines and tumor samples from
		  our cohort and another two datasets from GEO (Gene
		  Expression Omnibus) databases. Results. As a result, a
		  3-mRNA signature and 6-lncRNA signature were identified.
		  The six-lncRNA signature exhibited the highest prognostic
		  value. Notably, in the six lncRNAs, HOTTIP showed the
		  greatest prognostic value and was significantly correlated
		  with clinical stage and histological grade of HNSCC
		  patients. Furthermore, it was proved that HOTTIP was
		  upregulated in HNSCC cell lines and cancerous tissues
		  compared with corresponding normal cell lines and normal
		  tissues. Functional assessment analysis revealed that
		  HOTTIP might play a key role in the oncogenesis and
		  progression of HNSCC. Conclusion . The present study
		  deepened our understanding of the ceRNA-related regulatory
		  mechanism in the pathogenesis of HNSCC and identified
		  candidate prognostic biomarkers for clinical outcome
		  prediction in HNSCC. HOTTIP may function as a key candidate

		  RESULTS: In serum, levels of several metabolites related to

		  118 breast cancers were immunostained with antibody to
		  Glut1. The percent of Glut1-positive cancer cells in each
		  tumor was correlated with known prognostic markers, and
		  with patient outcome. RESULTS: Glut1 was expressed in
		  42{\%} of the tumors. Glut1 immunoreactivity correlated
		  positively with the proliferative activity as determined by
		  Ki-67 immunostaining, and with the total histologic score,
		  and showed negative correlation with bcl-2 immunostaining.
		  There was no correlation between the percent of
		  Glut1-immunoreactive cancer cells and estrogen receptor
		  status, tumor size, or lymph node status. CONCLUSIONS: 1)
		  Glut1 expression is increased in breast cancers with higher
		  grade and proliferative activity, and 2) glucose transport
		  in the majority of breast cancers may be mediated by a
		  glucose transporters other than Glut1.},

		  carcinoma cells are key events in the development of
		  metastasis to the lymph nodes and distant organs. Although
		  the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand, stromal
		  cell-derived factor-1$\alpha$, have been found to play an
		  important role in tumor invasion, its precise role and
		  potential underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In
		  this study, we showed that knockdown of CXCR4 significantly
		  decreased Tca8113 cells migration and invasion, accompanied
		  with the reduction of MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression.
		  Inhibition of ligand binding to CXCR4 by a specific
		  antagonist TN14003, also led to reduced cancer cell
		  migration and invasion. Because the degradation of the
		  extracellular matrix and the basement membrane by
		  proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is
		  critical for migration and invasion of cancer cells, we
		  investigated the expression of several MMPs and found that
		  the expression of functional MMP-9 and MMP-13 was
		  selectively decreased in CXCR4 knockdown cells. More
		  importantly, decreased cell migration and invasion of CXCR4
		  knockdown cells were completely rescued by exogenous
		  expression of MMP-9 or MMP-13, indicating that the two MMPs
		  are downstream targets of CXCR4-mediated signaling.
		  Furthermore, we found the level of phosphorylated

		  significantly decreased in CXCR4-silenced cells, suggesting
		  that ERK may be a potential mediator of CXCR4-regulated
		  MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression in Tca8113 cells. Taken
		  together, our results strongly suggest the underlying

		  by regulating MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression perhaps via
		  activation of the ERK signaling pathway.},

		  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for overall
		  survival (OS) by deep learning method. Methods: A total of
		  371 HCC patients with 20530 level three RNA-sequencing data
		  were from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cox-nnet model, a
		  deep learning model through an artificial neural network
		  extension of the Cox regression model, was used for OS
		  prediction. The patients were randomly split into train-set
		  and test-set (7:3). In train-set, the significant genes
		  associated with OS under univariate Cox regression were
		  considered for modeling. Clinical parameters, including
		  age, gender, pathologic stage, child pugh classification,
		  creatinine level etc. were also considered. The Cox-nnet
		  model was developed by cross-validation. Its discrimination
		  was determined by the concordance index (CI) in the
		  independent test-set and compared with multivariable Cox
		  regression. The clustering method Uniform Manifold
		  Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used for revealing
		  biological information from the hidden layer in the model.
		  Results: In the train-set (n = 259), 1505 genes and two
		  clinical variables (child pugh score and creatinine level)
		  were significantly associated with OS (adjusted P-value
		  {\textless} 0.05). To avoid overfitting, only 40 most
		  significant genes were included in the Cox-nnet model. In
		  the test-set (n = 112), the CI of Cox-nnet (0.76, se =
		  0.04) is better than the CI of multivariable Cox regression
		  (0.71, se = 0.05). The difference between good or poor
		  survival subgroups classified by Cox-nnet was remarkably
		  significant (P-value = 1e-4, median OS: 80.7 vs. 25.1
		  months). In the Cox-nnet model with all significant
		  variables, the weights in the hidden layer were clustered
		  by UMAP into 3 positive clusters and 2 negative clusters,
		  which are enriched in GO/KEGG. The ?cell cycle? and
		  ?complement and coagulation cascades? are the most

  abstract	= {The induction of proangiogenic cytokines such as vascular
		  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical feature of
		  tumor angiogenesis. In the present study, we examined the
		  mechanisms of VEGF gene expression induced by glucose
		  deprivation in cancer cells, a role of AMP-activated
		  protein kinase (AMPK) in the process, and the signal
		  transduction pathway. AMPK functions as an energy sensor to
		  provide metabolic adaptation under ATP-depleting conditions
		  such as hypoxia and nutritional deprivation. Here, we show
		  that glucose deprivation leads to a significant increase in
		  the mRNA level of VEGF, GLUT1, and PFKFB3 genes in several
		  cancer cells via a hypoxia-inducible factor-1-independent
		  mechanism, and we demonstrate an essential role of AMPK in
		  these gene expressions. Our data suggest that VEGF mRNA
		  induction by glucose deprivation is due to an increase in
		  mRNA stability, and the AMPK activity is necessary and
		  sufficient to confer the stability to VEGF mRNA. We further
		  show that reactive oxygen species is involved in glucose
		  deprivation-induced AMPK activity in DU145 human prostate
		  carcinomas, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase acts as an
		  upstream component in AMPK activation cascades under these
		  conditions. LKB1, which was recently identified as a direct
		  upstream kinase of AMPK, was not detected in DU145 cells.
		  In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel and major
		  role of AMPK in the post-transcriptional regulation of
		  VEGF, further implying its potential role in tumor
		  angiogenesis. Previous Section Next Section As solid tumors
		  outgrow the existing vasculature, they are continuously
		  exposed to microenvironments where the supply of oxygen and
		  nutrients are limited. Adaptation to such environments by
		  induction of new blood vessels is critical to sustain
		  neoplastic proliferation, and vascular endothelial growth
		  factor (VEGF)1 plays a central role in this process (1, 2).
		  A variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines express and
		  secrete high levels of VEGF, which in turn induces
		  proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial
		  cells. One of the best known environmental factors that
		  up-regulate VEGF expression in tumors is hypoxia, and this
		  induction occurs primarily via transcriptional activation
		  by HIF-1 (a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of
		  HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-1$\beta$) (3, 4). Its activity
		  largely depends on accumulation of the oxygen-regulated
		  subunit HIF-1$\alpha$, which is rapidly degraded under
		  normoxic conditions and is stabilized under hypoxic
		  conditions (3). Besides VEGF, several target genes,
		  including GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) and PFKFB3
		  (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3),
		  are up-regulated by HIF-1 (3, 4). In concert with
		  transcriptional regulation, hypoxia also increases the mRNA
		  stability of VEGF, and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR)
		  of the mRNA has been implicated in the regulation of its
		  stability (5). In addition to a lack of oxygen delivery,
		  glucose deprivation is another key factor to which tumors
		  must respond and adapt as they outgrow the existing
		  vasculature. In fact, several studies demonstrated that
		  glucose deprivation also induces VEGF expression in
		  different types of cancer cells (6–8), and a
		  post-transcriptional regulation has been implicated under
		  the existing conditions (6, 7). However, the precise
		  mechanism as well as the regulatory components for low
		  glucose-induced VEGF expression remain almost unknown.
		  AMPK, a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit
		  ($\alpha$) and two regulatory subunits ($\beta$ and
		  $\gamma$), functions as an energy sensor in eukaryotic
		  cells (9, 10). It is sensitively activated by allosteric
		  binding of AMP, which is accumulated as a result of ATP
		  depletion under various metabolic stresses such as hypoxia,
		  nutrition deprivation, oxidative stress, and exercise. AMPK
		  is also activated when it is phosphorylated by an upstream
		  kinase. Upon activation, AMPK down-regulates several
		  anabolic enzymes by phosphorylation and shuts down the
		  ATP-consuming metabolic pathways, whereas its activation
		  facilitates energy-producing pathways, thereby playing a
		  major role in energy homeostasis. We have previously
		  demonstrated that AMPK activity is critical for HIF-1
		  activity and its target gene expression such as VEGF under
		  hypoxic conditions (11). In the present study, we
		  investigated whether AMPK plays any role in the regulation
		  of expression of genes that are critically involved in
		  cancer adaptation and survival such as VEGF, GLUT1, and
		  PFKFB3 under glucose-deprived conditions. In particular,
		  our focus was on revealing the mechanisms of VEGF mRNA
		  induction, a role of AMPK, and its signaling pathway. Here,
		  we present novel evidence on the increase in VEGF mRNA
		  stability through ROS-mediated activation of AMPK in DU145
		  cancer cells under glucose deprivation. Moreover, we reveal
		  for the first time that JNK acts as an upstream signal
		  component of AMPK in the signal pathway.},

		  developing world. However, the etiology of OCSCC is still
		  unclear. Here, we explored the extent to which tobacco use,
		  Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and genetic and
		  transcriptomic changes contributed to the oncogenesis of
		  OCSCC. In a prospective observational study, we analysed
		  fresh tissue biopsies from 45 OCSCC collected from 51
		  subjects presenting with OCSCC to the Brisbane Head and
		  Neck Clinics between 2013 and 2015. Exploration of the
		  genetic and transcriptomic landscape of the biopsies were

		  sequencing. HPV associated tumours were determined using
		  p16 staining of histological sections and RNA sequencing.
		  Patient demographics including tumor location within the
		  oral cavity, and history of tobacco and alcohol use were
		  correlated with genomic and transcriptomics analyses. About
		  4.5{\%} of OCSCC were HPV associated. The most frequent
		  mutations in the OCSCC samples were in the TP53 and CDKN2A
		  genes, but no association of specific mutations with HPV or
		  tobacco use was observed. Using weighted gene co-expression
		  network analysis to explore the RNA-seq data, tumors from
		  participants with a history of tobacco use showed a
		  significant trend towards increased mammalian target of
		  Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and decreased mitochondrial
		  respiration. In conclusion, HPV was shown to be an uncommon
		  association with OCSCC and changes in TP53 transcriptional
		  regulation, mTOR signaling and mitochondrial function were
		  associated with a history of tobacco use. Larger data sets
		  will be required to enable detection of differences which

  abstract	= {IMPORTANCE Resection of the primary tumor with negative
		  margins is the gold standard treatment for squamous cell
		  carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). A microscopically
		  positive surgical margin is clearly associated with a
		  higher risk for local recurrence, whereas a negative margin
		  has traditionally been defined as greater than
		  5.0mmclearance from the tumor, with lesser margins
		  arbitrarily designated as close. The precise cutoff at
		  which the risk for local recurrence with a close margin
		  approximates that of a microscopically positive margin
		  remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the
		  arbitrarily defined close margin ({\textless}5.0 mm) would
		  portend as high a risk for local recurrence as a positive
		  margin after resection of SCCOT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
		  PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective study, head and neck
		  pathologists reviewed archived tumor specimens from 381
		  patients with SCCOT who underwent primary surgical
		  resection at a tertiary care center from January 1, 2000,
		  through December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed from November
		  15, 2015, to January 5, 2016. Time-dependent receiver
		  operating characteristic curve analysis was used in
		  patients who did not have a microscopically positive margin
		  to determine an optimal margin cutoff for local
		  recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Pathologic factors were
		  assessed for LRFS in a multivariate Cox proportional
		  hazards regression model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The
		  primary end pointwas evaluation of the margin distance
		  associated with LRFS. RESULTS Among the 381 patients
		  included in the analysis (222 men [58.3{\%}] and 159 women
		  [41.7{\%}]; mean [SD] age, 58 [14.7] years), the optimal
		  cutoff associated with LRFS was determined to be 2.2 mm.
		  This cutoff was compared with the traditionally accepted
		  cutoff of 5.0 mm. Patients with a margin of 2.3 to 5.0mmhad
		  similar LRFS as patients with a margin of greater than
		  5.0mm(hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95{\%}CI, 0.58-2.96), and
		  all other comparisons were significantly different (HR for
		  positive margin, 9.03; 95{\%}CI, 3.45-23.67; HR for 0.01-
		  to 2.2-mm margin, 2.83; 95{\%}CI, 1.32-6.07). Based on this
		  result, negative margins were redefined as those with a
		  clearance of greater than 2.2 mm. In a multivariate model
		  adjusting for pathologic factors, positive margins
		  (adjusted HR, 5.73; 95{\%}CI, 2.45-13.41) and margins of
		  0.01 to 2.2mm(adjusted HR, 2.00; 95{\%}CI, 1.13-3.55) were
		  the variables most significantly associated with LRFS.
		  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, local
		  recurrence-free survival was significantly affected only
		  with surgical margins of less than or equal to 2.2mmin
		  patients with SCCOT. This new definition of close margins
		  stratifies the risk for local recurrence better than the
		  arbitrary 5.0-mm cutoff that has been used.},

  abstract	= {Silybin, the major flavonoid of Silybum marianum, is
		  widely used to treat liver diseases such as hepatocellular
		  carcinoma and cirrhosis-associated insulin resistance.
		  Research so far has focused on its anti-oxidant properties.
		  Here, we demonstrate that silybin and its derivative
		  dehydrosilybin inhibit glucose uptake in several model
		  systems. Both flavonoids dose-dependently reduce basal and
		  insulin-dependent glucose uptake of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with
		  dehydrosilybin showing significantly stronger inhibition.
		  However, insulin signaling was not impaired, and
		  immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation showed
		  that insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma
		  membrane is also unchanged. Likewise, hexokinase activity
		  was not affected suggesting that silybin and dehydrosilybin
		  interfere directly with glucose transport across the PM.
		  Expression of GLUT4 in CHO cells counteracted the
		  inhibition of glucose uptake by both flavonoids. Moreover,
		  treatment of CHO cells with silybin and dehydrosilybin
		  reduced cell viability which was partially rescued by GLUT4
		  expression. Kinetic analysis revealed that silybin and
		  dehydrosilybin inhibit GLUT4-mediated glucose transport in
		  a competitive manner with K(i)=60 and 116 µM,
		  respectively. We conclude that silybin and dehydrosilybin
		  inhibit cellular glucose uptake by directly interacting
		  with GLUT transporters. Glucose starvation offers a novel
		  explanation for the anti-cancer effects of silybin.},

  abstract	= {The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator of cell
		  migration. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 activates FAK and
		  creates a binding site for Src family kinases. FAK
		  phosphorylates the cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin at
		  Tyr-12. Here we report that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B
		  (PTP 1B) is an alpha-actinin phosphatase. PTP 1B-dependent
		  dephosphorylation of alpha-actinin was seen in COS-7 cells
		  and PTP 1B-null fibroblasts reconstituted with PTP 1B.
		  Furthermore, we show that coexpression of wild-type
		  alpha-actinin and PTP 1B causes dephosphorylation at
		  Tyr-397 in FAK. No dephosphorylation was observed in cells
		  coexpressing the alpha-actinin phosphorylation mutant Y12F
		  and PTP 1B. Furthermore, the phosphorylation at four other
		  sites in FAK was not altered by PTP 1B. In addition, we
		  found that phosphorylated alpha-actinin bound to Src and
		  reduced the binding of FAK to Src. The dephosphorylation at
		  Tyr-397 in FAK triggered by wild-type alpha-actinin and PTP
		  1B caused a significant increase in cell migration. We
		  propose that phosphorylated alpha-actinin disrupts the FAK
		  x Src complex exposing Tyr-397 in FAK to PTP 1B. These
		  findings uncover a novel feedback loop involving
		  phosphorylated alpha-actinin and PTP 1B that regulates FAK

  abstract	= {Background When it is diagnosed early, gastric cancer (GC)
		  has a good therapeutic response with a high survival rate;
		  however, advanced and metastatic stages of the disease are
		  associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, identification
		  of novel biomarkers for GC is important for diagnosis,
		  prognosis, and therapeutic intervention improvement. This
		  study aimed to identify diagnostic and prognostic marker
		  genes of GC by combining bioinformatics analysis of gene
		  expression/sequence data. Methods A bioinformatics pipeline
		  was established to analyze and select differently expressed
		  genes from public available database GEO and TCGA. Briefly,
		  the following sets of conditions that satisfy the
		  requirements for the potential biomarker candidate genes
		  for GC are proposed: 1. They should be differentially
		  expressed between overall normal tissues and GC tissues
		  (fold change {\textgreater}1.5) in both microarray and
		  RNA-seq results (intersection of differential expressed
		  genes in TCGA and GEO data); 2. The differential expression
		  should be consistent among each microarray data series; and
		  3. They should keep stable expression of either increased
		  or decreased in all subgroups of TNM stages in all
		  available data. We have successfully applied the procedure
		  for identification of biomarkers for GC. Case-matched
		  normal and tumor tissues and serum samples were examined
		  and validated. Cell proliferation, invasion and connection
		  among candidate genes with major oncogene c-myc were also
		  examined. Results A total of 483 GC tissues and 105 normal
		  tissues were retrieved from public available database GEO
		  and TCGA. 13 candidate genes were selected by our
		  algorithm. Validation in our sample showed that 6 of the 13
		  candidate genes were expressed at significantly elevated
		  levels in GC tissues compared to normal tissues in 45 pairs
		  of tissues. Furthermore, high-level expressions of SMC4,
		  IGF2BP3 and E2F3 were associated with advanced tumor stage
		  or poor histologic type. Expression of these three genes
		  was validated in serum samples and showed distinguished
		  differences between GC and control patients. A number of
		  functional terms identified that shared among different
		  genes were identified, including cell cycle, positive
		  regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process and
		  cellular biosynthetic process. In addition, cancer-related
		  signaling pathways such as Hedgehog pathway, TGF-beta
		  pathway, NOD-like receptor pathway, antigen processing and
		  presentation and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation
		  were also found among candidate genes. KEGG pathway
		  analysis online showed that E2F3 and BMP6 were both related
		  to cell proliferation, MMP11 had an indirect effect on
		  sustained angiogenesis and was correlated with VEGF
		  signaling pathway, HSP90AA1 regulated androgen receptor and
		  indirectly affected proliferation, and E2F3 functioned in
		  the blocking of differentiation ROC curves were made
		  afterward and the sensitivity and specificity reached the
		  highest level when we combined the three genes together
		  (sensitivity: 83.3{\%}, specificity: 86.7{\%}, AUC:
		  0.9044). We thus wondered if E2F3 and 2 other identified
		  markers are targeted by c-myc in GC. qRT-PCR and Western
		  blot analysis suggested that siRNAs could significantly
		  downregulate c-myc expression. The expression of all the
		  three selected genes was significantly downregulated by
		  after c-myc inhibition, as identified both by qRT-PCR and
		  western blot. Luciferase reporter assay showed that
		  knockdown of c-myc significantly reduced the promoter
		  activity of IGF2BP3 (P=0.000), SMC4 (P=0.000), and E2F3
		  (P=0.000). Based on the above findings, we define these
		  three genes to classic oncogenes and propose an oncogenic
		  pathway implicated in gastric carcinogenesis. Conclusion
		  Our data suggest E2F3, SMC4 and IGF2BP3 as novel biomarkers
		  to establish the diagnosis and prognosis of GC by liquid
		  biopsy and could be considered a strategy to target these 3
		  genes as a potential adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer
		  treatment. In the future, a larger and more comprehensive
		  clinical study, as well as molecular mechanistic analyses
		  should be carried out to further dissect the detailed
		  functions of selected genes in GC, which could be
		  identified as useful clinical diagnostic and therapeutic
		  biomarkers.},

		  Mechanistically, we show that miR-873 activates the key

  abstract	= {Glucose is the major energy source for mammalian cells as
		  well as an important substrate for protein and lipid
		  synthesis. Mammalian cells take up glucose from
		  extracellular fluid into the cell through two families of
		  structurallyrelated glucose transporters. The facilitative
		  glucose transporter family (solute carriers SLC2A, protein
		  symbol GLUT) mediates a bidirectional and
		  energy-independent process of glucose transport in most
		  tissues and cells, while the NaM(+)/glucose cotransporter
		  family (solute carriers SLC5A, protein symbol SGLT)
		  mediates an active, Na(+)-linked transport process against
		  an electrochemical gradient. The GLUT family consists of
		  thirteen members (GLUT1-12 and HMIT). Phylogenetically, the
		  members of the GLUT family are split into three classes
		  based on protein similarities. Up to now, at least six
		  members of the SGLT family have been cloned (SGLT1-6). In
		  this review, we report both the genomic structure and
		  function of each transporter as well as intra-species
		  comparative genomic analysis of some of these transporters.
		  The affinity for glucose and transport kinetics of each
		  transporter differs and ranges from 0.2 to 17mM. The
		  ability of each protein to transport alternative substrates
		  also differs and includes substrates such as fructose and
		  galactose. In addition, the tissue distribution pattern
		  varies between species. There are different regulation
		  mechanisms of these transporters. Characterization of

		  been investigated and alternative promoter usage to
		  generate different protein isoforms has been demonstrated.

		  challenging public health problem worldwide. However, the
		  underlying molecular mechanism regulating the
		  carcinogenesis of OSCC is poorly known. Gene expression
		  profiles of GSE13601, GSE30784, GSE37991 and The Cancer
		  Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck cancer were downloaded
		  from gene expression omnibus (GEO) and TCGA database
		  respectively. R software and bioconductor packages were

		  common DEGs were then subjected to gene ontology (GO)

		  protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis as well
		  as survival analysis. A total of 76 up- and 102
		  down-regulated DEGs were identified. Functional analysis
		  revealed that these DEGs were associates with increased
		  oncostatin M signaling, cell diapedesis and extravasation
		  as well as reduced calcium signaling and loss of adherens
		  junctions and tight junctions. A set of robust prognostic
		  signatures including PLAU, CLDN8 and CDKN2A were identified
		  from DEGs and could predict overall survival in OSCC

  abstract	= {Background: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP), representing
		  approximately 3-5{\%} of all malignancies, is defined as
		  metastatic cancer where a primary site of origin cannot be
		  found despite a standard diagnostic workup. Because
		  knowledge of a patient's primary cancer remains fundamental
		  to their treatment, CUP patients are significantly
		  disadvantaged and most have a poor survival outcome.
		  Developing robust and accessible diagnostic methods for
		  resolving cancer tissue of origin, therefore, has
		  significant value for CUP patients. Methods: We developed
		  an RNA-based classifier called CUP-AI-Dx that utilizes a 1D
		  Inception convolutional neural network (1D-Inception) model
		  to infer a tumor's primary tissue of origin. CUP-AI-Dx was
		  trained using the transcriptional profiles of 18,217
		  primary tumours representing 32 cancer types from The
		  Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) and International Cancer
		  Genome Consortium (ICGC). Gene expression data was ordered
		  by gene chromosomal coordinates as input to the 1D-CNN
		  model, and the model utilizes multiple convolutional
		  kernels with different configurations simultaneously to
		  improve generality. The model was optimized through
		  extensive hyperparameter tuning, including different
		  max-pooling layers and dropout settings. For 11 tumour
		  types, we also developed a random forest model that can
		  classify the tumour's molecular subtype according to prior
		  TCGA studies. The optimised CUP-AI-Dx tissue of origin
		  classifier was tested on 394 metastatic samples from 11
		  tumour types from TCGA and 92 formalin-fixed
		  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples representing 18 cancer
		  types from two clinical laboratories. The CUP-AI-Dx
		  molecular subtype was also independently tested on
		  independent ovarian and breast cancer microarray datasets
		  Findings: CUP-AI-Dx identifies the primary site with an
		  overall top-1-accuracy of 98.54{\%} in cross-validation and
		  96.70{\%} on a test dataset. When applied to two
		  independent clinical-grade RNA-seq datasets generated from
		  two different institutes from the US and Australia, our
		  model predicted the primary site with a top-1-accuracy of
		  86.96{\%} and 72.46{\%} respectively. Interpretation: The
		  CUP-AI-Dx predicts tumour primary site and molecular
		  subtype with high accuracy and therefore can be used to
		  assist the diagnostic work-up of cancers of unknown primary
		  or uncertain origin using a common and accessible genomics
		  platform. Funding: NIH R35 GM133562, NCI P30 CA034196,

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: This study endeavors to build a deep learning
		  (DL)-based model for predicting disease progression in head
		  and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients by
		  integrating multi-omics data. METHODS: RNA sequencing,
		  miRNA sequencing, and methylation data from The Cancer
		  Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as input for autoencoder, a
		  DL approach. An autoencoder-based prognosis model for PFS
		  was built by SVM algorithm and tested in three confirmation
		  sets. Predictive performance of the model was compared to
		  two alternative approaches. Differential expression
		  analysis for mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) and methylation was
		  conducted. Moreover, functional annotation of
		  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was achieved through
		  function enrichment analysis. RESULT: The DL-based
		  prognosis model identified two subgroups of patients with
		  significantly different PFS, and showcased a good model
		  fitness (C-index = 0.73). The two identified PFS subtypes
		  were successfully validated in three confirmation sets. The
		  DL-based model was more accurate and efficient than
		  principal component analysis (PCA) or individual
		  Cox-PH-based models. There were 348 DEGs, 23 differentially
		  expressed miRNAs and 55 differentially methylated genes
		  between the two PFS subtypes. These genes were
		  significantly involved in several immune-related biological
		  processes and primary immunodeficiency, cell adhesion
		  molecules (CAMs), B cell receptor signaling and leukocyte
		  transendothelial migration pathways. CONCLUSION: The
		  DL-based model introduced in this study is reliable and
		  robust in predicting disease progression in HNSCC patients.
		  A number of pathways and genes targets are unraveled to be
		  implicated in cancer progression. Utility of this model
		  would facilitate development of more individualized therapy
		  for HNSCC patients and improve prognosis.},

		  Whether these factors impact cell motility directly,

		  found that the ectopic expression of Nanog, Sox2, or Oct4

		  phenocopied the ectopic expression of Nanog in both cell
		  motility and actin organization, whereas their ectopic

		  overexpression. Both proteins were upregulated during mouse

		  mouse P19 cells also increased upon Nanog ablation,

  abstract	= {Numerous innate and adaptive immune effector cells and
		  molecules participate in the recognition and destruction of
		  cancer cells, a process that is known as cancer
		  immunosurveillance. But cancer cells avoid such
		  immunosurveillance through the outgrowth of poorly
		  immunogenic tumour-cell variants (immunoselection) and
		  through subversion of the immune system (immunosubversion).
		  At the early stages of carcinogenesis, cell-intrinsic
		  barriers to tumour development seem to be associated with
		  stimulation of an active antitumour immune response,
		  whereas overt tumour development seems to correlate with
		  changes in the immunogenic properties of tumour cells. The
		  permanent success of treatments for cancer might depend on
		  using immunogenic chemotherapy to re-establish antitumour
		  immune responses.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Thermococcus gammatolerans was isolated from
		  samples collected from hydrothermal chimneys. It is one of
		  the most radioresistant organisms known amongst the
		  Archaea. We report the determination and annotation of its
		  complete genome sequence, its comparison with other
		  Thermococcales genomes, and a proteomic analysis.
		  
		  RESULTS: T. gammatolerans has a circular chromosome of
		  2.045 Mbp without any extra-chromosomal elements, coding
		  for 2,157 proteins. A thorough comparative genomics
		  analysis revealed important but unsuspected genome
		  plasticity differences between sequenced Thermococcus and
		  Pyrococcus species that could not be attributed to the
		  presence of specific mobile elements. Two virus-related
		  regions, tgv1 and tgv2, are the only mobile elements
		  identified in this genome. A proteogenome analysis was
		  performed by a shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass
		  spectrometry approach, allowing the identification of
		  10,931 unique peptides corresponding to 951 proteins. This
		  information concurrently validates the accuracy of the
		  genome annotation. Semi-quantification of proteins by
		  spectral count was done on exponential- and
		  stationary-phase cells. Insights into general catabolism,
		  hydrogenase complexes, detoxification systems, and the DNA
		  repair toolbox of this archaeon are revealed through this
		  genome and proteome analysis.
		  
		  CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first archaeal proteome
		  investigation done at the stage of primary genome
		  annotation. This archaeon is shown to use a large variety
		  of metabolic pathways even under a rich medium growth
		  condition. This proteogenomic study also indicates that the
		  high radiotolerance of T. gammatolerans is probably due to
		  proteins that remain to be characterized rather than a
		  larger arsenal of known DNA repair enzymes.},

		  most common cancer sites in Indian men. To assess the
		  effect of different patterns of smoking, chewing and
		  alcohol drinking in the development of the above 3
		  neoplasms and to determine the interaction among these
		  habits, we conducted a case-control study in Chennai and
		  Trivandrum, South India. The cases included 1,563 oral, 636
		  pharyngeal and 566 esophageal male cancer patients who were
		  compared with 1,711 male disease controls from the 2
		  centers as well as 1,927 male healthy hospital visitors
		  from Chennai. We observed a significant dose-response
		  relationship for duration and amount of consumption of the
		  3 habits with the development of the 3 neoplasms. Tobacco
		  chewing emerged as the strongest risk factor for oral
		  cancer, with the highest odds ratio (OR) for chewing
		  products containing tobacco of 5.05 [95{\%} confidence
		  internal (CI) 4.26-5.97]. The strongest risk factor for

		  ORs of 4.00 (95{\%} CI 3.07-5.22) and 2.83 (95{\%} CI
		  2.18-3.66) in current smokers, respectively. An independent
		  increase in risk was observed for each habit in the absence
		  of the other 2. For example, the OR of oral cancers for
		  alcohol drinking in never smokers and never chewers was
		  2.56 (95{\%} CI 1.42-4.64) and that of esophageal cancers
		  was 3.41 (95{\%} CI 1.46-7.99). Furthermore, significant

		  smoking 2-4 years before the interview.},

  abstract	= {The localization of Oregon Green cadaverine-labeled

		  the actin-binding motif (17-LKKTETQ-23). In contrast to
		  Oregon Green cadaverine, none of the variants or fragments

		  localization is neither dependent on the actin-binding
		  ability of thymosin beta(4) nor on its basic lysine
		  cluster. The equal distribution of the beta-thymosins, the
		  ability of the fragments thymosin beta(4)(1-26) and
		  beta(4)(27-43) to enter the nucleus in intact cells
		  immediately after injection, and their exclusion from

  abstract	= {Naringenin, a flavonoid found in high concentrations in
		  grapefruit, has been reported to have antioxidant,
		  antiatherogenic, and anticancer effects. Effects on lipid
		  and glucose metabolism have also been reported. Naringenin
		  is structurally similar to the polyphenol resveratrol, that
		  has been reported to activate the SIRT1 protein deacetylase
		  and to have antidiabetic properties. In the present study
		  we examined the direct effects of naringenin on skeletal
		  muscle glucose uptake and investigated the mechanism
		  involved. Naringenin stimulated glucose uptake in L6
		  myotubes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximum
		  stimulation was seen with 75 microM naringenin for 2 h
		  (192.8+/-24{\%}, p{\textless}0.01), a response comparable
		  to maximum insulin response (190.1+/-13{\%},
		  p{\textless}0.001). Similar to insulin, naringenin did not
		  increase glucose uptake in myoblasts indicating that GLUT4
		  glucose transporters may be involved in the
		  naringenin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition,
		  naringenin did not have a significant effect on basal or
		  insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation while significantly
		  increased AMPK phosphorylation/activation. Furthermore,
		  silencing of AMPK, using siRNA approach, abolished the
		  naringenin-stimulated glucose uptake. The SIRT1 inhibitors
		  nicotinamide and EX527 did not have an effect on
		  naringenin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and glucose
		  uptake. Our data show that naringenin increases glucose
		  uptake by skeletal muscle cells in an AMPK-dependent manner.},
